  question: What the heck is VoterMedia.org? What's it for? Who is behind this? Why are you doing this? What are your goals? Who is funding it? Who is working on it?
  answer: |
    Uh... relax, OK? VoterMedia.org is a public interest project for improving the policies of the world's organizations (governments, corporations, unions, nonprofits etc.) by developing better voter information systems. We are implementing voter funded media as explained in the paper <a href="/publications/GlobalVoterMediaPlatform.pdf">Global Voter Media Platform</a> and our other <a href="/publications">publications</a>.
    This website is built by a group of volunteers, led by <a href="/about_contact">Mark Latham</a>. We plan to create a nonprofit organization to manage the project, with a board of directors elected by the website's users. We are already practising what we preach, by <a href="/communities/104">inviting websites/blogs to critique VoterMedia.org</a>.

  question: How do you make money? How do you plan to make money?
  answer: |
    Our goal is saving the world, not making money. However, money can help get things done, so we invite donations from individuals, foundations, and the communities served by VoterMedia.org. So far the main donor to this project has been Mark Latham.
    
    In the long run, we expect most donations to come from the communities we serve. Most of those funds will flow through as awards to the websites/blogs serving those communities, ranked by voters. Donors will be able to designate which community's website ranking the funds will flow to, and whether to donate for the expenses of VoterMedia.org.

  question: Can I use the VoterMedia.org website without a login? What difference does it make whether I have a login here or not?
  answer: |
    Yes, you can use the site without a login. Most functions are available without logging in, including browsing the rankings, voting, adding communities and adding websites.
    
    We will gradually be adding more functions, and some of them will need you to log in, e.g. to customize your user interface in various ways.
    
    As you become comfortable with using the site, we invite you to create a login and participate more fully in the VoterMedia.org community. We plan to elect a board of directors to oversee the website, and our voting members will be active users with logins.

  question: How are the communities in VoterMedia chosen? What sort of communities should I add?
  answer: |
    VoterMedia.org website users and administrators choose what communities to add to the system. We recommend adding communities with over 1,000 voters and annual budgets over US$200,000. That gives enough scale to make a voted ranking of competing websites/blogs a worthwhile benefit to the community.

  question: How are the listed websites/blogs chosen? What sort of websites/blogs should I add?
  answer: |
    VoterMedia.org website users and administrators decide which websites/blogs to add to a community's list. You should add websites that you think provide a service to that voter community. These can be blogs, or websites for other media like newspapers, radio, TV.
    
    But it need not be limited to media. You could add websites/blogs from organizations that provide other community benefits that voters may want to support, including charities, events or whatever.

  question: Do I have to log in to vote? Do I have to be a member of that particular community to vote on its website/blog funding?
  answer: |
    No and no. You can vote in any community you care about, whether you log in or not. Later, we plan to also develop rankings based on votes from community members only, and let users see both rankings. Creating a member-votes-only ranking will require some coordination with the community's administration.

  question: How many websites/blogs should/can I vote funding for?
  answer: |
    You can vote for as many websites/blogs as you like.
    
    Of course, it makes the most sense to vote on websites/blogs that you know something about.

  question: How often do you count the votes?
  answer: |
    As of 2009-08-07, we were tallying votes at least once a day, updating the ranking in response. We may adjust this from time to time.

  question: By what criteria should I judge the websites when I vote?
  answer: |
    You can vote based on any criteria you want. You might want to consider whether some websites/blogs are already receiving funds through other channels. 
    
    VoterMedia.org is designed to direct funding to websites/blogs that benefit the voter community.

  question: How are votes tallied?
  answer: |
    We sometimes adjust our tallying method. Here's a description as of 2009-08-10:
    
    Percent shares are determined so that they sum to 100% and each website's share is supported by the same number of votes for that share or more.
    
    <br /><br />
    
    We count your latest vote for each website/blog, subject to "vote decay through time", which means that votes are weighted according to how old they are. Zero through 10 days old gets 100% weight. After 10 days, a vote's weight diminishes by 2% per day, so that its weight falls to zero when it's 60 days old. We call this "decayed_weight".
    
    So if you vote about once a week (as we suggest), your latest vote will always have 100% weight.
    
    <br /><br />
    
    If you vote to increase a share above the current share of (for example) 20%, we treat that vote as uniformly distributed from 20% to 100%. So later, if that website's share rises to 40%, then we estimate there is a one-quarter chance that you would no longer support increasing the share beyond 40%: (40-20)/(100-20) = 0.25
    <br />
    So the "support_fraction" of your vote is then 0.75 .
    
    <br /><br />
    Weight of vote = decayed_weight * support_fraction

  question: How do percent shares translate into cash awards?
  answer: |
    As of 2009-08-07 there are no cash awards yet, though we hope this will change soon. We will invite donations from foundations, individuals and governments, especially of the communities being served. The plan is for each community to have a balance of donations, from which e.g. one percent is paid out per day. That sum is divided among the competing websites/blogs serving that community, according to the consensus voted percent shares shown. Those shares are updated daily based on votes cast in the previous 60 days.

  question: Why should I care about VoterMedia? Why should I use the VoterMedia website? How should I use the VoterMedia website?
  answer: |
    VoterMedia.org is designed to benefit you by improving accountability of elected leaders. But we need your help to make that happen. Please add relevant blogs and communities to our system, check out some websites/blogs that serve your communities, and vote for those you think deserve higher rankings. Encourage your communities to fund their top-ranked websites/blogs.

  question: How does this website help achieve the goals of the VoterMedia project?
  answer: |
    This website builds support, exposure and reputation of websites/blogs that many voters consider beneficial. They may also receive financial support, when we get donations.
    
    These different kinds of support encourage websites/blogs to help voter communities. We think an important type of community benefit they will provide is a check and balance on the power of elected leaders, increasing accountability and thus improving the leaders' policies, decisions and administration.

  question: Wouldnâ€™t some media award contestants be biased, corrupted by bribery or other influence?
  answer: |
    Yes, there are likely to be such biases, just as there are in our current news media. But voter funding will add a new incentive for media to build reputations for serving the public interest, so we can expect them to produce better information.

  question: Why would voter-supported news media be any different from the news media we have now?
  answer: |
    Voting is a community service. Information to help people vote better is a public good. So it is not surprising that commercial markets do not supply enough of this public good, especially in terms of its quality. Commercial markets supply goods with personal benefits that people will pay for individually.
    
    Many experts and other citizens agree that we need to improve our public-interest media (see for example <a href="http://freepress.net">freepress.net</a>). The usual way to pay for public goods is with public funds. Normally public funds are controlled by politicians, but for political information that would be a conflict of interest, so voters should control that funding directly.
    
    The incentives that determine which media you pay for individually are different from the incentives for voting public funds. It makes sense to pay for your own entertainment, but when you are influencing the media going to all citizens, it is not in your interest to vote for entertainment for everyone, since most of that wouldnâ€™t benefit you. However, information that helps everyone vote more intelligently does benefit you. It is a public good that lacks the private benefit of entertainment. It is rational to be unwilling to pay as an individual for a public good, but to be willing to vote for everyone to pay for it. So the same citizens who buy <i>People</i> magazine at the checkout stand will vote public funds for serious investigative reporting.

  question: How do we know whether voter-funded media will actually be beneficial?
  answer: |
    No one knows for sure. There have only been a few trials so far; see an assessment in <a href="http://votermedia.blogspot.com/2009/02/ubc-ams-vfm-voting-results.html">this blog post</a>. The arguments in the paper "<a href="http://votermedia.org/publications/GlobalVoterMediaPlatform.pdf">Global Voter Media Platform</a>" are plausible, but the only way to find out is to try it. If voter funding for media is beneficial, we can apply it throughout democratic politics as well as for shareowner voting in corporations. So the potential benefits are huge compared to the cost of trying it out.
