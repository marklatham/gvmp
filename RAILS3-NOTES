* Views

All strings are automatically escaped. Therefore, you might see a lot
of html tags.

For example, this code:

  - site = 'Voter' + content_tag(:span, 'Media.org', :class => 'banner2')
  = link_to site, root_path

will show as html tags

  <span class="banner2">Media.org<span>

Fix by calling html_safe.
  link_to site.html_safe

Call 'html_safe' ONLY and ONLY IF you are absolutely certain that you
are producing safe html tags. Otherwise, this can cause security problems.

You can also call 'simple_format'. Useful for description and long text.

* Displaying Date and Time

Rails 2
  post.posted_at.to_s(:Y_mon)

Rails 3
  I18n.l post.posted_at, :format => :Y_mon
  
Or just use:
  'render_datetime'  (in communities_helper.rb)

  See config/locales/en.yml to set the various formats
