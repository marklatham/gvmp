All strings are automatically escaped. Therefore, you might see a lot
of html tags.

For example, this code:

  - site = 'Voter' + content_tag(:span, 'Media.org', :class => 'banner2')
  = link_to site, root_path

will show as html tags

  <span class="banner2">Media.org<span>

Fix by calling html_safe.
  link_to site.html_safe

Call 'html_safe' ONLY and ONLY IF you are absolutely certain that you
are producing safe html tags. Otherwise, this can cause security problems.
