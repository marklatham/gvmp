<h2>How You Can Help VoterMedia.org</h2>

<p>
Thank you for your interest in our mission to improve the policies of the world's organizations.
Here are some ways you can help:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Add relevant websites/blogs</b> to community pages with less than five websites/blogs listed. 
    You can search for them by googling keywords like "blog", "election" and the community name.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><%= link_to 'Add voter communities', new_community_path %></b> that are not yet in our system. 
    VoterMedia.org is most likely to be helpful for communities with more than 1,000 voters and annual budget over US$200,000.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Read some websites/blogs</b> listed for communities that you are interested in, 
    <b>and vote</b> for those that you think deserve to be ranked higher than they are now.
    (We suggest reading & voting about once a week.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Tell people</b> about VoterMedia.org.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Create a login</b> on VoterMedia.org and tell us more about you (e.g. your home city). 
    This helps us understand our user community. 
    We will invite active users to become voting members of the VoterMedia nonprofit association 
    and elect our board of directors, which controls this website.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Suggest improvements</b> for this website by email to Mark Latham: mark[at]votermedia.org; 
    or comment on the websites/blogs <a href="/communities/104">listed for the VoterMedia.org community</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Encourage your communities to fund</b> the top-ranked websites/blogs serving them.
  </li>
</ul>
