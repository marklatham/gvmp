%h2{:style => "text-align: center"} $3,000 for Bloggers Covering B.C. Municipal Issues

%div{:style => "margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"}

  %p
    British Columbia municipal elections were held on November 19, 2011. This blog competition started on October 1, 2011,
    to help inform voters. It will continue after the election to inform citizens about their elected leaders, policies and
    other community issues. VoterMedia.org will continue funding the blog awards for a period to be determined.
    We will also seek other sponsors. Even if funding stops for a while, the ballots will stay open for users to vote on blog rankings.
  %p
    To encourage better voter information,
    = link_to("VoterMedia.org", "/about_contact")
    is offering up to $3,000 in cash awards for blogs covering elections in 3 cities --
    up to $1,000 each for 3 blog competitions covering:

        %li= link_to("Burnaby", "/burnaby")
        %li= link_to("North Vancouver", "/northvan") + " (City + District)"
        %li= link_to("Surrey", "/surreybc")
  %p
    The competition is open to anyone, including professional journalists, independent bloggers and politicians.
    Judges will be the public -- anyone who votes on each city's votermedia.org ballot linked above.
    As you can see on the linked ballots, voters allocate award shares to the contestants.
    Votes are tallied as described in the
    = link_to("Voting FAQ", "/faqs#Voting") + "."
  %p
    In each contest, we plan to award up to $20 per day for 50 days, starting October 1.
    There is no entry fee or entry deadline, but voting has already started
    so the sooner you enter the better. Detailed rules are below.
  %p
    We have been running votermedia competitions at UBC's student union for the past 5 years.

    [You can enter the competition for more than one city, but please send a separate email for each city.
    Your blog URLs and/or post feed URLs (preferably both) must be different across cities.
    So you could have a separate blog for each city; or the same blog but with posts
    tagged by city, and tagged blog and feed URLs for each entry (like the Macleans blog at

  %h3{:style => "text-align: center"} Rules for VoterMedia BC Muni 2011 Competition

  %p
    In addition to the contest description on this page above, and the website terms at
    = link_to("votermedia.org/terms", "/terms") + ","
    the following also apply:
  %p
    As this is an experimental contest, we (the contest administrators) may change these rules
    during the contest as we see fit.
  %p
    We plan to mail award cheques at the end of each month, for the accumulated daily winnings
    of each contestant.
  %p
    If a contest has only one contestant, that contest's award pool will be $10 per day.
    Contests with more than one contestant will have an award pool of $20 per day.
  %p
    Each city's contest will start on October 1, 2011, or when its first contestant has entered,
    whichever is later. Each city's contest will end on November 30, 2011, or when $1,000 has
    been awarded, whichever is earlier. (After that, the contest ballot will remain open, but with no awards.)
  %p
    Most of the content in a contestant blog's posts feed should relate to
    matters of interest to that city's residents. We reserve the right to drop a blog from a contest if,
    in our judgment, this condition is not maintained.
  %p
    Election candidates may enter their campaign blogs in this competition.
    FYI this is for the following reasons:
    %ul
      %li openness and competition;
      %li it gathers election-relevant blogs onto one page;
      %li candidates are knowledgeable and may offer helpful insights about the election;
      %li it creates an interesting test of whether voters prefer to fund political campaigns or independent media;
      %li some non-candidate blogs may be very partisan anyway, or even shills for candidates;
      %li
        contest administrators should not be trying to figure out which blogs are truly "independent"
        (whatever that means); that distinction is for the voters to make, if they care.
