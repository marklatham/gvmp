Our mission is to save the world by improving the policies of our large organizations that depend on voting â€“ 
governments, corporations, labour unions, student unions, credit unions, NGOs, associations, co-ops, political parties etc. 
We aim to achieve this by improving the connection between voters and media. 
VoterMedia.org lets voters support media who help voters. 
This feedback loop will encourage the growth of media that build reputations for helping voters. 
That will empower voters to hold elected leaders accountable, thus improving these organizations' policies.
