%h3 How to enter the UBC Continuous VoterMedia (CVM) Competition:

%div{:style => "margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"}

  %p
    To enter your blog (or website or other media) in
    = link_to("this competition", "/ubc") + ","
    first create a link from your blog's home page to
    = link_to("the contest page", "/ubc") + "."
    This is required for entry, and helps direct your readers to the ballot so they
    can vote for you.
  %p
    Then there are two ways to go, depending on whether you are also entering the
    = link_to("One-Time VoterMedia (1VM) competition", "http://www.ams.ubc.ca/VM") + "."
    If you are entering 1VM, please fill out its entry form first,
    because its entry data are forwarded to Mark Latham. Then all you need to do is
    email (mark[at]votermedia.org) & tell him you'd like to enter CVM also.
  %p
    If you're not entering 1VM, then to enter CVM please copy-paste the
    = link_to("1VM entry form", 'http://ow.ly/ITGn0')
    into an email, delete the part about the entry fee,
    fill it in and email to (mark[at]votermedia.org).
  %p
    Then blog about the AMS elections to win funding in both contests!
