		      Subject: Turbo Democracy Comments</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Hi Mark,</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I spoke with you briefly after your  presentation to the AMS. I've just read through your paper and I thought I'd offer  some comments. (Turns out this is pretty long, sorry.)</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">It looks to me like what you're  trying for is a system that in a sense runs itself. There is no need for  regulation, and no opportunity for corruption. Voters determine both who gets  money and how much, so narrow interest groups aren't able to channel money  towards their own interests against the public good. This makes sense. However,  my feeling is that this ideal needs to be comprimised in the name of voter  accesibility.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I sit on the executive of the  Social Justice Centre at UBC, which gives several thousand dollars in grants  each year. We average something like a proposal every week or two. It is very  hard to determine how much we should grant to each request. We have to go over  their budget, look at other sources of funding, and decide if the amount they  are asking for is reasonable for the project they are working on. That is on  top of just evaluating if the project's aim is compatible with ours, and if the  project's scope makes it appropriate to be funded by students. For large  proposals deliberation can last weeks as we ask questions, have discussions,  and consider alternatives. It can be a daunting task. I cannot see how an  average voter is supposed to do this in any responsible way for up to a dozen  proposals, while just looking at a single ballott.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">The reply is, I suppose, that most  voters will simply vote &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; </span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">without considering the amount  requested. This is probably true, but it is not responsible voting. There is a  big difference between $5000 and $2000, especially for a group of students.  This difference will be hard for a voter to appriciate on voting day, while  spending 30 seconds filling out a ballott. The result is that there will be  some sort of game where proposers play amateur psychologist in deciding an  amount to request that will maximize their expected profit. They don't want to  request so much that the voter's stomach lurches, but they also don't want to  request less than they would be able to receive. Some proposers could even be  expected to short-change themselves in the name of caution. They may decide  that a 60% chance at $1000 is better than a 40% chance at $1800, even though  the latter has a higher expectation.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I would propose simply having  voters rate each media provider on a sliding scale, and have a committee  evaluate each budget along with this data to allocate the prize money  appropriately. This is not as iron-clad against corruption as your proposal,  but there can be checks and balances and formulas that minimize the potential  for abuse. This would allow voters to vote on what they are qualified to vote  on - what media they found useful - while allowing another group to do the hard  work of finding appropriate funding levels for the groups that voters direct  them to fund.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">My next concern is a broader  philosophical one. Corporate media is how it is today because the measure of  success is not quality of reporting but amount of profit. Thus, media is  rewarded for attracting and keeping the attention of readers, not for informing  them. The result is that it is more appropriate for a newspaper to be run by  the marketing department than the editorial department, or for the marketing  department to simply take the place of the editorial department. The measure of  success under Turbo Democracy is also not quality of information but amount of  profit. By bringing in a substantial monetery prize, media sources are  encouraged to behave in a way that will maximize their monetery returns. Now  ideally the way to maximize returns would be to provide good information, but  ideally the way to maximize returns for traditional newspapers would be to  provide good information, and hopefully we can agree that this isn't what  happens. Why should we expect it to work for Turbo Democracy when it doesn't  work for the rest of the media?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">My substantial worry is that  competitors in this experiment would have a large incentive to PROMOTE  THEMSELVES rather than provide information. </span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">When a student invests $200 for a  chance to get $2000 they are in essence investing in a small business. It is in  their best interest to do everything they can to ensure a profit. I see this  effort coming at the expense of being good information providers to students.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Having the $200 entry with a high  expectation of return and high variance will, I think, result in the field  being mainly larger institutional media than single intrepid reporters. Larger  institutions can stand the variance much more easily than an individual,  because they have a larger pool of money to start with. The Ubyssey with its  $350,000 (this surprised me, btw) annual budget wouldn't mind another $5,000  but it won't break the bank if they just lose $200.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">My feeling is that to combat this  both the variance and expected return need to be reduced. Good reporters with  minority viewpoints should not be discouraged from participating because they  don't expect people to like what they have to say. Media providers should not  have to labour under such uncertainty that they might be getting reimbursed for  thousands of dollars, or nothing. Rather, I think it would make more sense to  make the probability of winning some portion of the purse higher, and make the  maximum prize available lower. I would also like to reduce the entry fee  required to be in the contest, perhaps replaced by some other hurdle, such as a  full budget proposal and statement of intent - ie. discourage joke / selfish  entrants by making it not worth their trouble. Then make the maximum award  something more reasonable, like $500. There is still some incentive to do a  good job, but covering the election won't replace your day job. Thus you are  more likely to get contributors who care primarily about the democractic  process.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">About &quot;Turbo Democracy&quot; -  I share what seems to be the majority view that this isn't a great name. As I  mentioned to you before, it sounds like &quot;Sound Bite Democracy&quot; to me.  Personally, I like Slow Democracy, deliberative democracy. Turbo Democracy  sounds like a way to vote by cell phone or something, so it doesn't take time  out of my TV watching. </span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">On your card you have the phrase,  &quot;Media reform by majority vote funding.&quot; Why not just call it  &quot;Majority Vote Funding&quot;? MVF? People have expectations about what  something is by how its name sounds. Majority Vote Funding sounds academic and  responsible. Turbo Democracy sounds like a gimmick. For example, do you think  STV would have gotten more or less support if it was called Easy Vote?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Anyways, I'm not a marketer either.  We'd probably get more traffic at The Knoll's website if I was!</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">However it ends up being  implemented, I'm sure this will be a very positive experience for the AMS and  I'm really looking forward to seeing what will happen. As things develop The  Knoll will probably want to cover it more in detail and perhaps interview you  or something.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">And I'm more than willing to have  an involved discussion about this if you want to respond to my comments, but  don't feel duty-bound to.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Thanks Mike for taking the time to  read my paper and write some comments.&nbsp;  It's so helpful when people think seriously about how to implement  this.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to working  with UBC students on it, to anticipate problems and figure out how best to  handle them.&nbsp; Am digesting your  comprehensive feedback.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I'm open to many design  changes.&nbsp; Waiting to hear from the AMS  executive as to the next step, but it sounds like a committee will be formed to  work on this.&nbsp; If you're interested in  being on that committee, you could let Ian Pattillo or Kevin Keystone  know.&nbsp; (Ian's out of town now for a week,  by the way.)</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I appreciated your explanation of  why Turbo Democracy is not a good name.&nbsp;  The message is getting through to me.&nbsp;  I'm surprised I didn't get much criticism of the name during the almost  two years I've been using it.&nbsp; Maybe now  that people are seriously planning to announce this to voters, they take a  harder look at how it's going to sound.&nbsp;  Will think more about better names.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Hi Ian &ndash;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">How was  your trip?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I think it  would be good to choose a new name soon to replace &ldquo;turbo democracy&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;ve  given it some thought and would like to run some ideas past you.&nbsp; Please  let me know what you think.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">1. Turbo  Democracy -- Minuses: sounds gimmicky; many people at the AMS Council meeting  August 2 didn't like it.&nbsp; Pluses: distinctive, so would serve well as a  kind of brand name.&nbsp; (By this I don't mean a commercial trademark, but  just a clear identifier when people talk about it etc.)</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">2.  Voter-Funded Media --&nbsp;Pluses: not gimmicky; it's straightforward and  self-explanatory. &nbsp;Minuses: one reaction I've had to it so far is that it  lacks pizzazz, ring, poetry; it's not as distinctive, so not as good for a  brand name.&nbsp; ALSO: it&rsquo;s too long for a web domain name.&nbsp; So shorten  it to:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">3.  VoterMedia.org &ndash; this is easy to spell when you hear it spoken.&nbsp; Followup  slogan: Media for voters, funded by voters. &nbsp;Compare website names  FairVote.org, MoveOn.org, FreePress.net, DemocracyNow.org</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">There are  many uses/contexts for the name:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">- AMS  Council election; then other universities</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">- larger  democracies</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">-  corporations</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">- website</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">- business  card</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">- my  article I hope to publish in a law journal</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">We don't  have to use the same name in all contexts, although clearly there are benefits  from using a consistent name.&nbsp; Two-part names also possible -- now I'm  thinking of entitling my article &quot;Voter-Funded Media: Governance Reform  for Democracies and Corporations&quot;.&nbsp; My website and business card both  say &quot;TurboDemocracy.org&quot; and on the next line &quot;Media reform by  majority vote funding&quot;.&nbsp; My corporate governance reform website <a href="http://www.corpmon.com/" title="http://www.corpmon.com/"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.corpmon.com</span></a> says &quot;Corporate Monitoring&quot; then  &quot;Power to the Shareowners!&quot;&nbsp; There, the same voter-funded media  proposal is called &quot;Proxy Advisor Proposal&quot; because the organizations  that advise investors on voting shares are called proxy advisors.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Hello Ian  and Kevin &ndash;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I&rsquo;m  planning to attend your AMS Council meeting again next Wednesday August 23, so  that I can be available for any followup to the turbo democracy discussion from  the previous meeting.&nbsp; Would that be helpful?&nbsp; Also I&rsquo;d like to get  some feedback from council members about possible names to replace &ldquo;turbo  democracy&rdquo;.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I emailed  Ian a long list of possible words to use, but so far my favourite alternative is:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&ldquo;VoterMedia.org&rdquo;  for the website name;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&ldquo;Voter-funded  media&rdquo; for a descriptive term;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&ldquo;Media for  voters, funded by voters&rdquo; for a slogan or subheading;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&ldquo;Voter-Funded  Media: Governance Reform for Democracies and Corporations&rdquo; for the title of my  article that I&rsquo;m submitting to law journals.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Would it  make sense for you to send this to council members as part of their August 23  meeting materials?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">By the  way, let me know if you&rsquo;d like to have some council discussion on this without  my being there &ndash; I can step out of the room for a while or whatever.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">See you  next week...</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; color:navy;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; color:navy;">The  committee has been struck. We will meet in the next few weeks, and I will let  you know when that is to happen. I am trying to get an EA hired quickly so that  they can assist. You should really just continue to think about how this could  be administered with an AMS election. Advertised, too. &nbsp;</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Thanks  Ian for the update. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting going on this project.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">As  I outlined in my August 2 presentation to the AMS Council, a successful first  implementation of turbo democracy will require a lot of publicity and  education, especially for voters and for potential media contestants.&nbsp;  Here are the main steps I think we need to follow:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">1. Choose a name to replace &ldquo;turbo democracy&rdquo;.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">2. Decide the rules for the media competition,  including ballot format.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">3. Get AMS Council approval to proceed with  implementation.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">4. Publicize the competition to potential media  contestants.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">5. Media sign up, start covering AMS issues and  building their websites.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">6. We publicize the new info system to voters, with  media help.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">7. Media gradually gain reputation in the eyes of  voters and other media.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">8. Potential candidates decide to run for AMS  positions, partly because of this new info system that will help voters elect  good candidates.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">9. Election campaign period begins.&nbsp; Media cover  debates, interview candidates, write evaluations and endorsements.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">10. Media review and critique each other.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">11. Voters read media websites, vote for election candidates,  and vote funds to media contestants.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">12. Candidates are elected; media awards are paid out.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">All  these stages take time.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I recommended phasing it in over the  next two elections.&nbsp; I was happy to hear Council&rsquo;s enthusiastic response favouring  a faster full implementation in January 2007, but for that to be successful we  would have to move fast.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I  think it&rsquo;s important for voters, media and candidates to develop their  understanding of how this new info system works, before the election campaign  starts. &nbsp;That education process is in steps 5, 6 and 7 above, and can be  expected to take several months.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Ideally,  I would have liked to be at step 5 by now as the semester begins.&nbsp; How  fast can we play catch-up and get the first four steps done?&nbsp; As each week  goes by, the chance of success diminishes for a full implementation by January  2007.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Can  we do step 1 (choosing a name) by email and phone, instead of waiting for the  first committee meeting?&nbsp; This is urgent for marketing &ndash; e.g. the Ubyssey  will publish an article about this any day now; also I can get going on  building a new website.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Please  let me know your thoughts on these plans and the timing challenge.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s  talk soon.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><strong><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Subject:</span></strong><span style="font-family:Tahoma;"> Turbo democracy committee</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Thank you for working on this project to make  democracy work better.&nbsp; We are going to change the world!</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">We have many things to talk about at our meeting  tomorrow. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s one key item: &nbsp;Based on feedback so far (especially  from Mike Thicke), I&rsquo;ve revised my suggested design.&nbsp; Thought it would be  helpful to sketch it out for you to think about before we meet:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">1. To encourage a diverse range of media, cap each  award at e.g. $3000.&nbsp; That way one dominant media organization won&rsquo;t get  most of the pool.&nbsp; At least four awards will be given out.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">2. I had suggested a ballot design where each media  contestant requests an award amount, then students vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; or write  in another amount.&nbsp; One problem with this is the strategic gamesmanship  involved for each contestant to choose their requested amount.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m OK  with either leaving the design that way, but now think it&rsquo;s better to eliminate  the Yes/No part and just have each voter choose a dollar amount for each  contestant.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">3. Mike pointed out that choosing award amounts may be  difficult for many voters.&nbsp; He suggests instead that voters rate each  contestant e.g. on a scale of 1 to 10, and then a committee use those as input  to deciding award amounts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid that runs contrary to my goal of  creating a check and balance to government &ndash; too much government discretionary  control over media funding.&nbsp; As a compromise, that government-appointed  committee could itself be one of the media contestants.&nbsp; Contestants are  expected to give voters guidance not only on voting for electoral candidates,  but also on voting funds for media.&nbsp; This committee-contestant could  specialize in advising on media budgets, and not give advice on electoral  candidates.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">4. My previous design of awarding the median voted  amount had some nice properties (like being based on majority vote) but would  almost certainly end up awarding either more than $10,000 and have to be  adjusted down, or awarding less than $10,000 (maybe zero!).&nbsp; Media  contestants would prefer to have more assurance as to how much award will be  given out.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Here&rsquo;s how to solve both those problems at once.  &nbsp;We base our awards on the consensus level that allocates the full $10k:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- If there is a Yes/No option, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the same as  writing in the requested amount, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; is the same as writing in zero.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- If a voter doesn&rsquo;t vote for a given contestant,  that&rsquo;s the same as voting $0 (we could change this, but it&rsquo;s probably the simplest  fair design).</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- For each contestant, arrange the voted amounts for  that contestant in increasing order from $0 to $3000.&nbsp; Suppose there were  1000 voters.&nbsp; Then each contestant would have 1000 voted amounts, where #1  is probably $0 and #1000 is probably $3000.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- For each rank #1 through #1000, sum the voted  amounts across all contestants.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- Find the two consecutive ranks #n and #(n+1) where  the #n summed amount is below $10k and the #(n+1) summed amount is above $10k.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- Find the weights so that the weighted average of  those two amounts is $10k.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- Award each contestant the similarly weighted average  of their #n amount and #(n+1) amount.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- This system virtually guarantees that the full $10k  will be awarded.&nbsp; Only in the unlikely event that the #1000 sum is less  than $10k, the awards would be the #1000 amount for each contestant.&nbsp; I  think you&rsquo;ll agree this is an extremely unlikely case.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">5. This new design is much more generous.&nbsp; If  there are only 4 contestants, each one is guaranteed at least $1000 just by casting  one vote for themselves!&nbsp; So we can be sure more than 4 will enter the  contest.&nbsp; Maybe then $10k is too much award, or $200 is too low an entry  fee?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Let&rsquo;s talk about it &ndash; see you tomorrow!&nbsp;  (Thursday, September 21, at 5:15 pm in SUB Room 266J)</span></p>

                  <strong>Subject:</strong> Simplified Award Voting Design</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">During our meeting last Thursday, I thought up a new  simpler design for award voting which I&rsquo;d now like to write out and run past  you.&nbsp; This is partly in response to our concerns about the complexity of  determining award amounts by vote, and partly because we expect that Webvote  may not handle write-in amounts.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Suppose we offer a predetermined sequence of media  awards, such as:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">1<sup>st</sup> prize: $2,500</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">2<sup>nd</sup> prize: $2,000</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">3<sup>rd</sup> prize: $1,500</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">4<sup>th</sup> prize: $1,000</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">5<sup>th</sup> prize: $500</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Voters simply click to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on as many media  contestants as they like.&nbsp; Thus voting would be formally similar to the  senator elections where voters can choose multiple candidates, but without the  limit of five that a voter may select.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m assuming senator elections  have this limit of five, and we could impose it here too, but I don&rsquo;t think  that&rsquo;s necessary or desirable.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Then the 1<sup>st</sup> prize goes to the contestant  with the most votes, 2<sup>nd</sup> prize to the one with the second most  votes, etc.&nbsp; Tie votes would be settled by awarding the average amount.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Desirable features of this design:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">1. Webvote can surely handle it.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">2. The voting format is easy to understand, and  familiar to students.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">3. The connection from votes to awards is easy to  understand, and would seem reasonably fair to most people, being  straightforward and similar to many other voting contests.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">4. This award system would give a clear incentive for  media contestants to appeal to as broad a consensus of voters as  possible.&nbsp; This should discourage extremism, while encouraging a variety  of coverage that would not neglect any substantial voter subgroup.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">5. This array of awards would induce a minimum of five  contestants to enter.&nbsp; The total number of entrants would also be greatly  affected by the entry fee.&nbsp; I suggest a fee of about $200, which I hope  would result in about 10 or so entrants &ndash; enough for variety, competition and  cross-checking, but not too many for busy students to read.&nbsp; The entry fee  funds could be used for award system infrastructure and advertising costs.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">6. These awards could give reasonable incentives to  both large and small media groups, from the Ubyssey to individual bloggers.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Voter media awards are designed to empower voters, so  I generally prefer to give voters as much control over award allocation as  possible.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why my previous designs let each voter write in an  allocation if desired.&nbsp; If we choose the above simplified design, voters  would lose the option of expressing their degree of consensus separately from  their desired award amounts.&nbsp; For example, with write-in amounts, voters  could express an 80% consensus for awarding $1000 to contestant A, and an 80%  consensus for awarding $3000 to contestant B.&nbsp; In the simplified system  however, % consensus is treated as synonymous with award size ranking.&nbsp;  That is the price we would pay for simplicity.&nbsp; I view this as &ldquo;training  wheels&rdquo; that we would plan to remove in the future, when participants are more  familiar with how voter media awards work.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Looking at the pluses and minuses, at this point it  seems to me that the above simplified system is preferable to others we have  considered, even if Webvote could support the other, more complex systems.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">What do you think?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">I&rsquo;ll send you this email now so you can start  digesting it.&nbsp; Probably tomorrow I plan to send a followup email outlining  the designs &ldquo;A, B and C&rdquo; that we discussed at our Thursday meeting.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Meanwhile a few notes on the total award amount.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;m sure you did the math to see that my suggested awards above total to  $7,500.&nbsp; Whichever design we choose, we&rsquo;ll have to decide what we think  the best award amount and entry fee are.&nbsp; I suggested what I did here for  these reasons:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">1. My original proposed design offered $10,000 total,  but required minimum 50% consensus vote for any contestant to get an  award.&nbsp; There would have been some chance that no one would qualify.&nbsp;  Here, the design would guarantee that these 5 awards totalling $7,500 would be  given out (except for the extremely unlikely case where most contestants get  zero votes).&nbsp; This guarantee makes it easier and more attractive for  contestants, so the total potential award pool need not be as big.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">2. We can reasonably expect 10 or so entrants, which  seems to me about what we want.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">3. It&rsquo;s getting a bit late to launch the competition,  so contestants won&rsquo;t spend as much total time prior to the campaign period  covering AMS issues as I had thought.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m still in favour of launching,  but with this smaller award pool.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">4. I&rsquo;m starting to think that I will probably offer to  sponsor this again for the January 2008 AMS Council election, so a smaller pool  this time makes it easier for me to afford doing that.&nbsp; We can expect our  voter media system to evolve in various ways, including removing some &ldquo;training  wheels&rdquo;, getting AMS Council to liberalize the restrictive election rules,  improved understanding by voters and media, etc.&nbsp; So a followup year would  be very desirable if it goes well the first year.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">I look forward to seeing what you think of all this.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">This might be a little scattered.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Concerns:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">1) Does this encourage strategic  voting? That is, a vote of &quot;yes&quot; for 10/10 candidates is the same as  voting for none at all. A vote of &quot;yes&quot; </span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">for just one candidate is the best  option if what you care about is that candiate getting money, and each  subsequent &quot;yes&quot; vote makes your overall contribution smaller.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">2) Before it seemed we were trying  to fairly compensate people for good work. It's possible that every single  entrant would get paid, if they all did a good job. The pool would be spread  thin, but it seems likely that all of the good efforts would have gotten a  reward. So it didn't feel like so much of a contest. Now it is explicitly a  contest.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">3) In the old system, was an  abstain the same as a &quot;no&quot;? I'm unclear reading your paper. I think  this is bad, because it means that institutions with greater access to the  voters (eg. The Ubyssey) have a very large advantage. In fact I think that there  is a very high (like</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">90%) chance that the Ubyssey would  win first place under the new system, whether or not it deserved it. That the  AMS pays the Ubyssey to cover the elections makes this even more unpalatable.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">4) Do we really want to have a  system that rewards &quot;centerism&quot; </span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">specifically? I don't believe that  centerists have any natural claim to being right, so a system that is designed  specifically to reward them seems biased. There is a difference between having,  say, an ethno-centric perspective and having an unpopular political  perspective. </span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I am happy with a system that does  not reward very narrow interests, but I am not happy with a system that  excludes unpopular opinions.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">5) The current media system seems  to be very concentrated on personal attributes and competancy. Did Bush really  desert from the national guard? Things like that. Competancy issues  intrinsically have a wide appeal, as everyone responsible should care about  electing someone who is at least capable of doing the job. However they should  not, in my opinion, drown out political debate and ideologies. This is what  seems to happen - campaigns focus on people, not issues. Does this system</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">(either) fall into the same trap of  encouraging media to focus on universally-appealing issues like competancy rather  than on trying to evaluate the issues? I would like it if there could be media  contestants actively setting the agenda for candidates and forcing them to take  positions, rather than on some sort of muckraking activity.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">6) I feel that $200 is a very large  hurdle for students to clear before entering the contest.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">7) I support reducing the overall  prize pool (not that it's really any of my business). I'd also like to suggest  making the distribution flatter.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">That's probably more than enough  for now.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Voting is just Yes or No on each contestant.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; means voting for a $3,000 award?&nbsp; Also not sure what the rule is for  determining which media get awards.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Voting is just Yes or No on each contestant.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Contestant with the most Yes votes gets 1<sup>st</sup> prize, etc.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">For designs C and D, voting is only by Yes/No on each  contestant.&nbsp; Normally (e.g. in Webvote I believe), that is done by  clicking a single box next to each contestant&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; There is no &ldquo;No&rdquo;  box to click, only a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; box to either click or leave unclicked.&nbsp; So I  guess that would mean that there&rsquo;s no way to distinguish &ldquo;No&rdquo; from a blank non-vote  on that contestant.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">But if we offer both a Yes/No option and a write-in  option (e.g. design A or B), I guess we would have a Yes box, a No box, and a  write-in box.&nbsp; Then it would be possible to distinguish between an active  &ldquo;No&rdquo; (same as write-in $0) meaning &ldquo;Dislike &ndash; give $0!&rdquo; versus a passive  leaving that contestant blank meaning &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know or don&rsquo;t care&rdquo;.</span></p>

                  <strong>Subject:</strong> RE: Simplified Award Voting Design</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">We have a range of possible contest designs, and concerns  about them. &nbsp;Here's a suggestion for how we can bite off a smaller first  step for our decision process: </p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">Let's start by figuring out which design we would choose  if Webvote limits us to voting just by clicking (or not clicking) a single box  next to each contestant's name.&nbsp; Let's limit this further by supposing we  wouldn't have a different suggested or requested award amount next to each  name.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">Thus for example, this effectively postpones Mike's  concern #3 to a later decision stage, when and if we can also have a  &quot;No&quot; box and/or $-amount box.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">There is no perfect design.&nbsp; The design we choose  will reflect tradeoffs. &nbsp;When we look at an imperfection, we need to ask  what alternative design we can think of, see if it compromises some other  aspect, then weigh the pros &amp; cons.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">So what contest designs are possible with single-box  voting?&nbsp; Out of the A B C D designs we&rsquo;ve looked at so far, I guess only  design D qualifies here. &nbsp;But there are others.&nbsp; Besides changing the  entry fee and award schedule, we could choose:</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1"><u>Design E</u></p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">Every contestant getting over 50% Yes votes receives  $1500 [or $2000], unless more than 5 contestants qualify, in which case the  $7500 [or $10,000] pool is divided equally among them.&nbsp; This resembles  designs B and (I think) C, and would be more cooperative / less competitive  than design D.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1"><u>Design F</u></p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">Voucher system: Divide the total award pool by the number  of voters. &nbsp;Then for each voter, divide the per-voter award equally among  the contestants selected by that voter. &nbsp;Each contestant&rsquo;s award is the  sum across voters of these amounts.&nbsp; [I oppose voucher systems for reasons  I&rsquo;ve described earlier, e.g. in my &ldquo;Turbo Democracy&rdquo; paper. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m just  listing this as another possible design example.]</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">No doubt there are many other possible designs under  single-box voting.&nbsp; If you can think of any that we should consider,  please describe them.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">Here are my thoughts on Mike&rsquo;s concerns, numbered as in  his email below:</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">1)&nbsp; I agree that some types of vote counting  rules encourage strategic voting in a way that seems socially  undesirable.&nbsp; An example would be a first-past-the-post election with  three or more candidates (e.g. Bush vs Gore vs Nader in 2000), in which you  might not vote for your favourite one (e.g. Nader) if you think he has no  chance, so you vote Gore.&nbsp; A better system would let you express your  honest preference by ranking Nader 1, Gore 2, Bush 3 and then count votes using  a Condorcet method (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method</a>).</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">But the design D we are considering here doesn&rsquo;t seem  as strategic as that to me.&nbsp; Each voter has a different insight to  contribute to the group decision.&nbsp; If you only like one contestant, just  vote yes for that one.&nbsp; If you like nine of them equally well, but detest  the tenth one, vote yes for your nine even though only five of them can win  prizes.&nbsp; The other voters&rsquo; insights will decide which five of the nine are  better (or might outweigh you and reward the tenth).</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">For typical voters with more graduated preferences, it  won&rsquo;t be so clear where to make the cutoff of which fair-to-middling  contestants to vote yes for.&nbsp; But that doesn&rsquo;t seem too serious or  socially harmful to the consensus decision process.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Another aspect that could be considered strategic is  trying to compensate for the one-dimensionality of yes-bpx voting that I  mentioned in my Sept 24 description of this design.&nbsp; (Maybe this is what  Mike had in mind.)&nbsp; Design D treats consensus as synonymous with award  size rank.&nbsp; What if there is a blogger that everyone likes, but doesn&rsquo;t  really need to be paid $2500?&nbsp; $500 or $1000 would be enough.&nbsp; If you  think most voters will vote yes for her, you might not vote yes even though you  like her ideas the best, because you want the bigger awards to go to media  groups that have put more time and effort of more people into their work.&nbsp;  That would be a voting strategy that I hope many voters would factor into their  decision, to help compensate for the limitations of yes-box voting.&nbsp; I  doubt that other yes-box designs can avoid this issue (can they?), but we  should revisit it if and when we can consider richer voting options like  write-in amounts.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">2) I agree design D is more explicitly like a contest  than design B, and that may have some negative effects.&nbsp; I think the  interaction of media contestants with one another will be a crucial component  of the voter media system.&nbsp; We need the media to review and critique each  other.&nbsp; We want that critiquing to be balanced, with reviews sometimes  favourable, sometimes unfavourable, based on balanced intelligent opinion  rather than factional competitive mudslinging.&nbsp; We should think about what  flavour of interaction our system design would induce.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Even with a competitive system though, I hope and  expect that voters would not reward contestants that descend into factional  bickering and knee-jerk criticism of competitors, so such behaviour would be  minimized.&nbsp; And competition can have the positive effect of inducing  better service to voters.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">I think design D is more competitive than design  E.&nbsp; This goes hand in hand with the aspect of whether the entire award  pool is guaranteed to be paid out.&nbsp; If so, then one contestant getting  more implies others must get less.&nbsp; But design E has a significant chance  of not paying out the full pool.&nbsp; That implies the disadvantage of  uncertainty as to how smart/generous/coordinated the voters will be in giving  out award funds.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t have it all &ndash; no perfect system &ndash; so must  choose which tradeoff we want to make.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">3) As I  mentioned above, it looks to me that with only a yes-box there&rsquo;s no way to  distinguish abstain from no. &nbsp;Do you agree, or am I missing something  here? </p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">I agree  there is something unpalatable about a big Ubyssey advantage leading to an easy  first-place win. &nbsp;But the Ubyssey&rsquo;s competitors will make sure that voters  know how much student money the Ubyssey is already getting.&nbsp; I believe in  informing voters well, then letting them decide.&nbsp; On a closely related  issue, you plan to recommend to Council that they allow all newspapers to  compete, including those with AMS funding, right?&nbsp; You would probably also  recommend that if AMS-funded groups are banned, then the Ubyssey should be  banned too, right?&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s kind of a negotiation point.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">That  still leaves the design question of whether to reward contestants who get more  votes.&nbsp; It may give the Ubyssey an advantage, but still I think it&rsquo;s so  important to encourage information with broad public benefit. &nbsp;This seems  to be an issue where a concrete alternative proposed system would help focus  our discussion of pros &amp; cons.&nbsp; I invite Mike or anyone to suggest one  (or say that you like design E) if you would like us to pursue this question.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">4) Here  too I think a specific suggested alternative design would help us focus the  discussion.&nbsp; Design D rewards votes, regardless of where in the  left-centre-right spectrum they come from.&nbsp; So does design F  (vouchers).&nbsp; But F would reward many narrow-interest media whereas D would  reward only broad-interest media.&nbsp; My economic analysis indicates that our  existing media fail us especially in not providing insights of broad voter  community interest.&nbsp; Letting voters allocate collective funds by voucher  invites them to spend the money on media that give less social benefit than the  social cost.&nbsp; I would rather spend my $5 voucher to create a $1 benefit  for a group of 100 that I belong to (1 cent for me), rather than a $10 benefit  for a group of 10,000 that I belong to (1/10 of a cent for me).&nbsp; So I  think design F would create less benefit than its cost, whereas design D would  create more benefit than its cost.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">From my  outline of design D: &nbsp;&ldquo;This award system would give a clear incentive for  media contestants to appeal to as broad a consensus of voters as  possible.&nbsp; This should discourage extremism, while encouraging a variety  of coverage that would not neglect any substantial voter subgroup.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I  don&rsquo;t think monority views (ethnic or political) will be excluded. &nbsp;I  expect to see media appealing to a broad range of views, often providing  political insight that would be useful to any voter regardless of their stance.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">5) I  agree that existing media focus too much on gossipy superficial  stimulation.&nbsp; I think this is driven by the economics of channel-surfing  viewers getting entertained.&nbsp; Those same viewers (or rather, the ones that  vote) also want deeper political insight, but aren&rsquo;t sufficiently willing to  pay for it by spending much time on such a serious channel.&nbsp; But they  would vote public funds for it, then use that info briefly before they  vote.&nbsp; So I predict that our new voter-funded media will quiz candidates  on issues more effectively than existing media.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">6) I  agree $200 is a substantial hurdle, and might well discourage some worthwhile  potential contestants.&nbsp; The purpose of the hurdle is to limit the amount  of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; that voters have to wade through to get at the &ldquo;signal&rdquo; of helpful  political insight. &nbsp;&ldquo;Noise&rdquo; includes partisan campaigns (which may well be  disguised as news), and other types of advertising &ndash; single-issue cranks who  want to push their issue to all student voters (hmm, that sounds like me!),  perhaps even commercial advertisers (again, mixed with news).&nbsp; A  simplistic but helpful way to think about it is that we only want entrants who  think they have a real chance at winning some prize money.&nbsp; Award voting  is what sorts out signal from noise.&nbsp; As you know, I don&rsquo;t favour having  an oversight committee that outlaws some types of media content (e.g. for being  partisan or commercial).&nbsp; I count on the other media to critique such  content, and I count on voters to reward good content.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">Even  $200 may be too small.&nbsp; Suppose 4000 students read those web pages.  &nbsp;For a $200 advertising fee, that&rsquo;s only 5 cents per person you can  reach.&nbsp; Thinking about it this way, I&rsquo;d be nervous about a lower  fee.&nbsp; The fee should be high enough to screen out most noise, and then the  awards should be high enough to attract public-interest media, who must expect  to win enough award to pay back their entry fee plus compensate them for  journalism work.</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">7) For  reference, here are the design D awards (call this schedule D1):</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">1st  prize: $2,500</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">2nd  prize: $2,000</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">3rd  prize: $1,500</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">4th  prize: $1,000</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">5th  prize: $500</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">I  encourage any of you to comment on how much the total prize pool should  be.&nbsp; As for flatness, let&rsquo;s compare specific alternatives.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s  one (D2):</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">1st  prize: $2,000</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">2nd  prize: $1,700</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">3rd  prize: $1,400</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">4th  prize: $1,100</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">5th  prize: $800</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">6th  prize: $500</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">Here&rsquo;s  another (D3):</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">1st  prize: $1,800</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">2nd  prize: $1,500</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">3rd  prize: $1,200</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">4th  prize: $1,000</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">5th  prize: $800</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">6th  prize: $600</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">7th prize:  $400</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">8th  prize: $200</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">These  also add to $7,500.&nbsp; Keep in mind the tradeoff of how much the average  busy student voter is willing to read.&nbsp; How many more contestants will  enter than the number of prizes? &nbsp;What do you all think?&nbsp; Other  suggestions, comments etc?</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">I think  we need to make progress on these decisions soon, so please share your views  with an eye to reaching your committee consensus.</p>

                  <strong>Subject:</strong> Followup on our 20061005 meeting</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Here I&rsquo;ll try to write down some of what we decided at  the voter media committee meeting last Thursday, and make it more specific.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">We reached consensus on having an entry fee of $100.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">One major debate we had was between two contest  designs:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><u><span style="font-family:Arial;">Design D:</span></u></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">VoterMedia voting appears in the ballot somewhat like  the student senator race, but without the five-vote limit.&nbsp; Each  contestant gets just one line, with a single box to click indicating voter  approval for award.&nbsp; Each student can vote for as many contestants as  desired.&nbsp; Contestant with the most votes gets first prize, second most  votes gets second prize, etc.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><u><span style="font-family:Arial;">Design E:</span></u></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">This design from Matt may be the same one he suggested  on Sept 21 which I called design C and didn&rsquo;t really understand.&nbsp; But to  be safe I&rsquo;ll call it design E now.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Each media contestant gets their own ballot race, with  perhaps four possible award amounts, each with a voting click-box next to  it.&nbsp; Each voter clicks one amount-box for each media contestant.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Ian is going to check into whether Webvote can  accommodate design E.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">In case we end up choosing Design D, we reached a  consensus on what the award sequence should look like.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t  completely specify the award sequence, so I&rsquo;ll try to do that now.&nbsp; As I  understood it, we decided on having 8 awards ranging from $500 to $1500.&nbsp;  If we space those evenly, the difference between consecutive awards would be  $1000/7 = $142.86 .&nbsp; So I suggest rounding the step size off to $150 and  lowering the 8<sup>th</sup> prize to $450 &ndash; call this schedule D4:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">1st  prize: $1,500 </p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">2nd  prize: $1,350</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">3rd  prize: $1,200</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">4th  prize: $1,050</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">5th  prize: $900</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">6th  prize: $750</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">7th  prize: $600</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">8th  prize: $450</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">These sum to $7800.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Is that close enough to what we agreed on?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Next I&rsquo;ll write an email about possible ways we could  specify Design E.</span></p>

                  <strong>Subject:</strong> VoterMedia Design E options</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">If we go with Design E, we have several choices to  make in specifying it.&nbsp; First, here&rsquo;s the general description again:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&ldquo;Each media contestant gets their own ballot race,  with perhaps four possible award amounts, each with a voting click-box next to  it.&nbsp; Each voter clicks one amount-box for each media contestant.&rdquo;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><u><span style="font-family:Arial;">Choices &ndash; we would need to decide:</span></u></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">1. Award options &ndash; e.g.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">(a) $1500, $1000, $500 &ndash; This would be similar to the  range of our design-D awards.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">(b) I think Matt was suggesting something like $3000,  $2500, $2000, $1500, $1000, $500.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">(c) A compromise intermediate offering could be $2000,  $1500, $1000, $500.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Here we are trading off precision of voters&rsquo; wishes  versus length of the ballot.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">2. Non-vote = $0 vote?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">If a voter leaves one contestant&rsquo;s ballot section  blank, is that the same as voting for $0?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Closely related question: should we have a $0 option?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">If blank is different from $0, then presumably we  should have a $0 option. How would blank i.e. non-votes then be treated?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">If blank is same as $0, we don&rsquo;t need to have a $0  option; in fact, it may make this point clearer to voters if we don&rsquo;t have a $0  option.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">3. How votes are tallied to determine awards &ndash;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">(a) We could award the median voted amount for each  contestant. But we&rsquo;ve seen the problems with that: &nbsp;If that adds to more  than the prize pool, scale them all down proportionally.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s less  than the award pool, then the full pool is not paid out and the remainder goes  back to the sponsor.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">(b) Instead of the median (50% point), find the level  of consensus that exactly allocates the full award pool.&nbsp; This is similar  to my &ldquo;Design A&rdquo; that I emailed you on Sept 10.&nbsp; For a specific example,  I&rsquo;ll suppose here that we chose award option 1(c) above, and non-vote = $0  vote:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- For each contestant, arrange the voted amounts for  that contestant in increasing order from $0 to $2000.&nbsp; Suppose there were  1000 voters.&nbsp; Then each contestant would have 1000 voted amounts, where #1  is probably $0 and #1000 is probably $2000.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- For each rank #1 through #1000, sum the voted  amounts across all contestants.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- Find the ranks #n where the summed amount equals the  award pool total.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- Award each contestant their #n amount.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">(Because the award options are in $500 steps and the  pool would be a multiple of $500, it&rsquo;s unlikely we&rsquo;d have to average two ranks  #n and #(n+1), but we&rsquo;d write that possibility into the official rules.)</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Would it be too complicated /  undesirable to have a &quot;no opinion&quot; option that counted as half a vote  for $0?

This would make self-promotion less of an issue.</span></p>

		      Subject: Non-votes vs $0-votes</p>
		    <p class="MsoPlainText style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I agree that passively not voting  on a contestant is a weaker negative signal than actively voting $0.&nbsp; So counting a non-vote as half of a $0 vote  seems reasonable to me, even desirable as a good way to interpret voter  preferences.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Some people might think this looks  weird and perhaps unfair in some vague way, having half votes.&nbsp; They might be more comfortable with a  clear-cut rule in either direction -- non-vote counts the same as $0 vote, or  non-votes are ignored.&nbsp; Some might even  contest the &quot;legality&quot; of half-votes.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I would be OK with half-votes, or  with counting non-votes the same as voting $0.&nbsp;  As for ignoring non-votes, I think it would depend on the specific vote  counting system we use.&nbsp; I would be  afraid of cases where a contestant was ignored by most voters but strongly  supported by a small group of friends/allies/members of that contestant.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">We would have to decide this  non-vote / $0-vote issue if we choose Design E, but not if we choose Design D.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="text-autospace:none;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">As for Mike's second point (email below),  I'm making an example of scaling versus consensus threshold adjustments, and  will send it in a later email.</span></p>

		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial;">Scaling down medians versus raising consensus  threshold</span></strong></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">This responds to Mike&rsquo;s question:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&ldquo;I am somewhat unclear as to the practical differences  in payouts that would result in the simple scaling vs. the median adjusting  methods. </span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Could you perhaps give a concrete example where we can  see what each system would result in?&rdquo;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Below I give a specific example to illustrate the  difference between these two systems.&nbsp; Although I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it as  simple as possible, it&rsquo;s still pretty complicated.&nbsp; So first, here&rsquo;s the  executive summary:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Fitting the awards to the total pool by changing the  consensus threshold (rather than scaling the medians) allocates the awards  where more voters want them allocated.&nbsp; Scaling the medians may shift the  allocation away from where most voters think it should be.&nbsp; We give voters  the power to express their choices about how much to award each contestant, so  I recommend that we follow their choices as much as possible by changing the  threshold instead of scaling.&nbsp; However, it may not make a big difference  so I&rsquo;m not dead set on this decision.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">To focus on these two systems, I have made a very  simplified example: only two contestants, 5001 voters (easy to find the  median), a $10,000 pool (easy to see proportions), and $1 voting increments  instead of $500 (easy to see subtle effects).&nbsp; I designed the numbers to  make the results symmetrical &ndash; neither system gives more &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; than the  other.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see what I mean below.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">In asking voters to choose award amounts for each  contestant, we are assuming that voters have some meaningful insight into what  levels are appropriate for each contestant.&nbsp; I believe voters will have  this kind of insight, especially with the help of media critiquing each other  and advising on award levels.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">To illustrate most clearly how voter preferences would  work differently in these two systems, I will suppose that the array of voter  opinions is quite different for contestant A than for contestant B.&nbsp; For  contestant A, suppose voters unanimously agree that A should get $5100.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">For contestant B however, let us suppose that there is  a wide range of disagreement.&nbsp; To get the symmetrical result that I think  will help us focus on the main effect, suppose the voter with the lowest  contestant-B vote chooses $2808, the next lowest chooses $2809, and so on by $1  steps so the highest contestant-B vote is $7808.&nbsp; The median contestant-B  vote is then $5308.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">So the two medians are $5100 for A and $5308 for B,  totalling $10,408 -- more than the available $10,000 award pool.&nbsp; We could  scale the awards down proportionally by dividing each by 1.0408, giving an  award of $5100/1.0408 = $4900 for A, and $5308/1.0408 = $5100 for B.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Alternatively, we could raise the consensus threshold  higher than the 50% median, until the awards sum to $10,000.&nbsp; Since voters  were unanimous in choosing $5100 for A, raising the threshold won&rsquo;t change A&rsquo;s  award; but B&rsquo;s award would gradually drop until it reaches $4900, which happens  at the 2093<sup>rd</sup>-lowest voter = 2908<sup>th</sup>-highest voter = 58<sup>th</sup> percentile.&nbsp; So the threshold would be raised from 50% to 58%.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">So how can we make sense of this difference?&nbsp;  Which system is better?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Here&rsquo;s one way to approach the comparison:&nbsp; Both  systems agree that A and B should get at least $4900 each.&nbsp; The systems  just disagree about who should get the last $200.&nbsp; (That&rsquo;s the symmetry I  designed for.)</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Note that this example wouldn&rsquo;t be affected if 42% of  the voters wanted A to get less than $5100.&nbsp; The final threshold was 58%,  so A only needed 58% of that unanimous support.&nbsp; For the argument that  I&rsquo;ll make next, it makes more sense to say A has 58% support at $5100 rather  than 100% support.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Note also that if we use scaling and give $5100 to B,  that&rsquo;s B&rsquo;s 2293<sup>rd</sup>-lowest voter = 2708<sup>th</sup>-highest voter =  54<sup>th</sup> percentile.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">So now compare giving that last $200 to A versus to  B.&nbsp; More specifically, compare giving the last $1 of that $200 to A versus  to B.&nbsp; 58% of voters said A should get that $1.&nbsp; 54% of voters said B  should get that $1.&nbsp; Scaling gives it to B.&nbsp; Adjusting the consensus  threshold gives it to A.&nbsp; The threshold method systematically allocates  the awards according to where the most votes are.&nbsp; (This principle also  applies for thresholds below 50%, compared to scaling median awards up.)&nbsp;  This seems to me more respectful of the voters&rsquo; decisions, and encourages the  media to strive for the broadest consensus support.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">A more realistic example would not have such strong  unanimity.&nbsp; But the difference between the two systems would still be  driven by the degree of unanimity about A versus about B.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">[We would  have to decide this scaling-versus-threshold issue if we choose Design E, but  not if we choose Design D.]</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">As my aunt  would say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as clear as a glass of muddy water!&rdquo;</span></p>

                  <strong>Subject:</strong> Voter media issues</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Here&rsquo;s an updated summary of where I stand on some of  our main issues.&nbsp; Overall I&rsquo;m happy with the range of designs we are  considering.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">1. Lead time:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">As you know, I&rsquo;ve been concerned about the short time  frame from now until the January 2007 election.&nbsp; Nonetheless I&rsquo;m glad  we&rsquo;re going ahead with it, and we&rsquo;ll do our best to make it successful.  &nbsp;The challenges will be for potential media contestants to learn about the  competition soon enough to build their websites; and for voters to learn about  it and form opinions/reputations about media quality.&nbsp; It would help if  the media had time to cover AMS issues (including for example constituency  elections) in advance of the main election.&nbsp; I will most likely offer to  sponsor this again for January 2008, when we will have plenty more lead time.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">2. Award pool size:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I have some flexibility here, so would appreciate  hearing what you think would make sense. &nbsp;In my August 2 pitch to Council  I suggested $10,000.&nbsp; I am still willing to sponsor that amount if you  think anything less would be backing out on my offer.&nbsp; Lately I&rsquo;ve been  suggesting in the $7500 - $8000 range, having trimmed it a bit because there&rsquo;s  less time for the media to work, we&rsquo;ve adjusted the rules to make sure the  whole pool gets paid out, we&rsquo;ve set the entry fee to half of what I had  suggested, and I&rsquo;m feeling more likely to offer to sponsor again next  year.&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t said much about this issue, so I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re  comfortable with the ranges we have been talking about lately.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">3. Entry fee:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I&rsquo;m glad I could at least talk you into $100.  &nbsp;Maybe that will be enough to keep out noise-generating entrants that I  would call basically spammers.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">4. Design D (one check-box per contestant) versus  Design E (four or more amount check-boxes per contestant):</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">This is a tradeoff.&nbsp; I like the voter power and  flexibility of Design E, which lets them choose award amounts for each  contestant. &nbsp;But I also like the simplicity of Design D &ndash; it asks less of  Webvote, is easier for voters, and doesn&rsquo;t look like the media vote is taking  more ballot space than the main election.&nbsp; So I tend toward Design D for  this year, and consider something more sophisticated next year. &nbsp;But if  you prefer Design E and can get it into Webvote, that&rsquo;s fine with me.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">5. Secret ballot:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Is Webvote a confidential voting system? &nbsp;I guess  not, if you can vote from any computer connected to the internet. &nbsp;This  opens the danger of vote-selling: you can show someone how you are voting, and  receive a payoff for your choice.&nbsp; Do you know if you can change your vote  later? &nbsp;That would greatly limit the potential for vote-selling.&nbsp; I  guess we&rsquo;ll have to make do with however Webvote works, but I should at least  mention this danger to you. &nbsp;With cash prizes at stake, this kind of  corruption becomes more likely.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">6. Election rules:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">I support recommending to Council that AMS resource groups  and constituencies be allowed to endorse candidates. &nbsp;I support  recommending that slates be allowed.&nbsp; Both of these changes would would  help the VoterMedia competition work better. &nbsp;And conversely, the  VoterMedia competition would help reduce the problems these restrictions were  designed to help solve.&nbsp; But I think we can and should go ahead with the  competition even if Council doesn&rsquo;t make these rules changes.</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">7. Publicizing the competition:</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Although AMS Council won&rsquo;t make its official decision  on launching this until October 25, I&rsquo;d like to make a preliminary heads-up  contact to the Georgia Straight ASAP.&nbsp; Is that OK with you?&nbsp; How  about other potential media contestants?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">Do you plan to launch via an AMS announcement in the  Ubyssey soon after October 25?</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		    <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;">8. AMS Council meetings October 11 (today) and 25:</span></p>

Do not  do this on the document, because I'd rather&nbsp;not read it through that many  times. Just make a response and cite the necessary areas. If you rewrite the  whole thing then you may send the doument back but please rename it. This goes  out to Council on Monday AM. I will be circulating it to Sheldon, Code and the  Executive before then, but don't expect them to make any changes at that time  (excepting perhaps Sheldon wanting to make the lnaguage more Code-like, even  though I said 'Shall' where ever possible). ANyhow, I hope you enjoy and in  case that wasn't clear, if you want anything to change you have 24 hours to  tell me. Thanks for being the only committee that I have ever seen do anything  other than make lousy management decisions. Love Ian</span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I&rsquo;m  impressed that you wrote the report so well in so short a time.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Here  are some suggested revisions:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">1.  I think we&rsquo;ve now settled on a total award pool of $7850.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">2.  In the agreement between me and the AMS, I would appreciate some reassurance  that if for some reason the funds end up not being used for voter media awards  (e.g. Council cancels the contest), they will be refunded to me.&nbsp; How  about adding this to point #1?:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&ldquo;If the AMS awards a total of less than $7,850 to the Voter  Funded Media contest participants, the AMS will refund to Mr. Latham by March  31, 2007 the difference between $7,850 and the total amount so awarded.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">3.  I understand and agree that it makes sense for point #2 to clarify that  sponsoring and advising on VFM gives me no right to interfere in the election.  However, you would agree that I would still be free to express my opinions, in  the same way as if I were not involved in this at all, right? &nbsp;To make it  clear that expressing my opinions would not be considered interfering, how  about adding this?:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&ldquo;This condition does not, however, restrict Mr. Latham&rsquo;s  freedom to express his opinions.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I&rsquo;ve  attached a revised agreement with these suggested changes.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I  suggest adding the following second sentence (underlined) to Code Article 14  point 5. This is to prevent demands by participants for more space, multiple  links etc.:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">5.  A central site will be located on the AMS elections website that will list the  participants, who may also choose to submit a brief statement and have links to  their respective websites. <u>The elections committee will determine the length  and format of participants&rsquo; content allowed on the AMS elections website.</u></span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Article  2 Section 8(c):</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I  suggest this slight rewording (changes underlined) &ndash;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.5in;">&ldquo;Neither the Student Resource Groups  nor the Society&rsquo;s Constituencies shall spend money or resources on behalf of  any candidates, with the exception <u>of any</u> publication dependent on a  Resource Group or Constituency for funding <u>that</u> has entered the Voter  Funded Media Contest and abided by all procedures outlined in Section IX: A:  Article 14.&rdquo;</p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I  thought of a couple more points:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">1.  You could mention the reasons why our proposed award total is now $7,850  instead of the original $10,000:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">(a)  The entry fee is $100 instead of the originally suggested $200.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">(b)  Media contestants are no longer required to get 50% voting support in order to  get an award.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">(c)  There is limited time for the media to provide coverage of AMS issues in  advance of the election.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">2.  In Article 14 point #8, the 4<sup>th</sup> prize of 1050 is missing its dollar  sign.</span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Two  questions about our planned agreement, in particular the main sentence &ldquo;</span>Once  the AMS Council has passed a motion instituting Voter Funded Media for the  elections of January 2007, Mr. Latham will be required to transfer $7,850 to  the AMS within 5 business days.<span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&rdquo;:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">1.  The Council &ldquo;motion instituting VFM&rdquo; refers to what&rsquo;s planned for November 8,  not the approval in principle planned for October 25, right? &nbsp;So if all  goes as planned, I&rsquo;ll have 5 business days from November 8 to make the payment?</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">2.  Is a personal cheque on my Royal Bank account OK, or should I do a wire  transfer?</span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">I think I  will make those adjustments, so thanks again for your input. As for the money,  the situation I was trying to create was one where you would only be required  to pay if we actually made it happen, obviously, but also one that would commit  your funds in such a way that you could not excercise control over the process  once it is under way. I think this is something council would expect to see.  They don't know you like the committee does so I think we have expect them to  be suspicious of your plans here. So you are correct, the november 8th meeting  is the beginning of the 6 day&nbsp;time period. I will have to change it to  explicitly state that institution is Code changes, not support in principle.  And I believe a cheque would be just fine, but I will double check for you. See  you,</span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; color:navy;">Executive  response to the report, like most people, has been cautiously optimistic.  Everyone is keen to see this thing in action, but there remain some very real  hesitations. I attach the primary questions raised in executive committee  yesterday. Some of them we have answers to. The last one I do not. We are, in  some sense, giving people the opportunity to get around elections spending  guidelines and create massive propaganda campaigns. My faith in the voter wanes  when leaflets start falling from the sky. Just because my blog says that  Stephanie Ryan is on a massive spending spree to become President does not mean  that anyone will read it as opposed to the scatter copies of the Underground on  the B-Line home. I think that piece of Code will remain. Assuage my diffidence,  committee! And then do the same for council. Ian</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; color:navy;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; color:navy;">Their  questions:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; color:navy;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <ul type="disc" class="style1" style="margin-top:0in;">
              <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Wasn&rsquo;t the prize money       originally $10,000?&nbsp; </span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Who pays the prize money after       this coming election?</span>  </li>
              <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;">What&rsquo;s the worst scenario that       could happen with Turbo Democracy?</span>  </li>
              <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;">What due diligence has been       done in reviewing the proposal?&nbsp; Have &ldquo;experts&rdquo; been consulted other       than Latham?</span>  </li>
              <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;">If Constituency papers can       support candidates, then couldn&rsquo;t constituencies &ldquo;buy&rdquo; the election by       diverting money into their paper to support a candidate from their       constituency?&nbsp; Would that lend an unfair advantage to constituencies       with a lot of money to spend?</span>  </li>
              <ul style="margin-top:0in;" type="circle">
                <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;">An example: a Constituency        paper like the 432 could spend lots of money and put out lots of issues        to sway the election, allowing the candidate they endorsed to get around        the spending restrictions, and thus affecting the democratic        process.&nbsp; So I guess this amounts to the question: how can we        maintain a level playing field for election finances if Constituencies        can spend what they like?</span>  </li>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">[From  my Oct 11 email:]</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Award  pool size:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I  have some flexibility here, so would appreciate hearing what you think would  make sense.&nbsp; In my August 2 pitch to Council I suggested $10,000.&nbsp; I  am still willing to sponsor that amount if you think anything less would be  backing out on my offer.&nbsp; Lately I&rsquo;ve been suggesting in the $7500 - $8000  range, having trimmed it a bit because there&rsquo;s less time for the media to work,  we&rsquo;ve adjusted the rules to make sure the whole pool gets paid out, we&rsquo;ve set  the entry fee to half of what I had suggested, and I&rsquo;m feeling more likely to  offer to sponsor again next year.&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t said much about this issue,  so I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re comfortable with the ranges we have been talking about  lately.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">2. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Who pays the prize  money after this coming election?</span> </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I  don&rsquo;t think anyone would want to commit to future years until we see how the  first election with voter-funded media goes.&nbsp; That said however, I am  pleased with how our plans have been developing, and I believe the benefits of  VFM will grow with time and experience as everyone learns how it works.&nbsp;  The benefit this year should also be enhanced if participants expect it to  happen again in the future. &nbsp;That gives media more incentive to invest in  their reputations, foregoing sensationalism in favour of giving insight that  will still look good in retrospect a year later. &nbsp;So I expect to be  willing to sponsor it again for the January 2008 AMS election.&nbsp; Of course  we&rsquo;ll have much more lead time then too.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">After  January 2008 however, I would hope to step back and see if the voters like VFM  enough to want to pay for it from general AMS funds.&nbsp; Another possibility  could be to find another sponsor.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">3. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;">What&rsquo;s the worst  scenario that could happen with Turbo Democracy?</span> </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">My  biggest concern is if apathy is too pervasive for VFM to make an impact.&nbsp;  I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have trouble getting at least 8 media contestants, but  maybe we won&rsquo;t be able to get enough students to read the media websites and  vote on awards.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">The  scenario about Constituency papers is addressed in #5 below.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">4. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;">What due diligence has  been done in reviewing the proposal?&nbsp; Have &ldquo;experts&rdquo; been consulted other  than Latham?</span> </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">I&rsquo;ve  had a wide range of feedback on these ideas in the past 10 years. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll  outline it in a separate email later today.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">5. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;">If Constituency papers  can support candidates, then couldn&rsquo;t constituencies &ldquo;buy&rdquo; the election by  diverting money into their paper to support a candidate from their  constituency?&nbsp; Would that lend an unfair advantage to constituencies with  a lot of money to spend?</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial;">- An  example: a Constituency paper like the 432 could spend lots of money and put  out lots of issues to sway the election, allowing the candidate they endorsed  to get around the spending restrictions, and thus affecting the democratic  process.&nbsp; So I guess this amounts to the question: how can we maintain a  level playing field for election finances if Constituencies can spend what they  like?</span> </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">One  possible strategy for avoiding this danger could be to allow Student Resource  Groups and Constituencies to favour or endorse candidates <u>only on website  pages</u>, and require that each of those pages have a link at the top to the  AMS Elections VFM page.&nbsp; (This link requirement might be a good idea for  all VFM contestants.)&nbsp; They could advertise their web pages in their print  publications, but limiting endorsements to those web pages would put them on a  more equal footing with all the other VFM contestants&rsquo; endorsements. &nbsp;Web  pages are almost costless to put up, and the links to the main VFM page would  encourage voters to read the other contestants&rsquo; views too.&nbsp; This way we  would get the benefit of those papers&rsquo; reporting and writing talents, without  giving them an unfair advantage over less well funded media contestants.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">If  you want to do that, you could revise Article 2 Section 8(c) to become:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;&ldquo;Neither the Student Resource  Groups nor the Society&rsquo;s Constituencies shall spend money or resources on  behalf of any candidates, with the exception that they may enter the Voter  Funded Media Contest and, if so entered, favour and/or endorse candidates on  worldwide web pages only, provided that the top of each such web page contains  a clearly indicated link to the main AMS Elections Voter Funded Media Contest  web page.&rdquo;</p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Here  are some responses to the questions &ldquo;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">What due diligence has been done in reviewing the proposal?&nbsp;  Have &ldquo;experts&rdquo; been consulted other than Latham?</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&rdquo;:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Our  VFM proposal is the latest evolution of an idea that I have been publishing  since 1997.&nbsp; During that time I have had a lot of feedback on it, some  positive, some negative &ndash; samples of both are linked below.&nbsp; Given the  wide range of reactions plus the fact that it has not yet been implemented, no  one can really be sure whether or not it will be beneficial.&nbsp; But it has  been reviewed by enough smart people to at least give assurance that it is  based on reasonable arguments.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Publications:  see lists at <a href="http://www.turbodemocracy.org/publications.htm"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.turbodemocracy.org/publications.htm</span></a> and <a href="http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.corpmon.com/publications.htm</span></a> (these overlap quite a bit). &nbsp;Most of my papers were reviewed by editors  and/or referees in order to qualify for publication. For example, <em>Corporate  Governance: An International Review</em> and <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em> are well respected journals in their fields.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Presentations:  see list at <a href="http://www.turbodemocracy.org/presentations.htm"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.turbodemocracy.org/presentations.htm</span></a> . &nbsp;I list not  only the institutions but also the individuals who hosted my talks, so that  people can contact them and ask about the quality of past presentations.&nbsp;  Note in particular the repeat invitations by UBC Sauder School Professor Kai Li  (3 times), U C Berkeley Haas Business School Professor Nils Hakansson (5  times), and Santa Clara University business school Professor Atulya Sarin (3  times).</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">On  the negative side, I&rsquo;ve taken lots of flak from corporate boards and their  legal hired guns when I have submitted VFM-type proposals as a  shareowner.&nbsp; A typical example is at <a href="http://www.corpmon.com/OS-debate.htm"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.corpmon.com/OS-debate.htm</span></a>.  &nbsp;There&rsquo;s plenty more linked from <a href="http://www.corpmon.com/"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.corpmon.com</span></a>, including in Microsoft&rsquo;s current proxy  (search there for &ldquo;Latham&rdquo;).</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Further  confirmation that this type of proposal makes some sense can be found in  related publications by respected researchers. &nbsp;I review many of these in  my paper &ldquo;Turbo Democracy&rdquo; (soon to be retitled) at <a href="http://www.turbodemocracy.org/publications.htm"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.turbodemocracy.org/publications.htm</span></a>.&nbsp;  Prominent among them is the 2002 book &ldquo;Voting With Dollars&rdquo; by Yale professors  Ackerman and Ayres.&nbsp; It proposes letting each American voter direct $50 of  public funds every 4-year election cycle to political candidates and related  organization campaigns.&nbsp; Of course, I criticize it for being a voucher  system; and it focuses on campaigns, not media. &nbsp;Nonetheless, it provides  some experts&rsquo; confirmation of the idea that letting voters direct public funds  could improve a democracy&rsquo;s political information process. &nbsp;The book was  so well received that the California Law Review and the University of Richmond  Law Review each devoted a special issue to articles discussing it.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">In  the field of media reform, leading guru University of Illinois Professor Robert  McChesney (see <a href="http://www.freepress.net/content/faqs#question15"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">www.freepress.net/content/faqs#question15</span></a>) favours a  proposal by economist Howard Baker to let each voter allocate $100 (per year, I  think) to nonprofit media.&nbsp; Detailed reference is on page 10 of &ldquo;Turbo  Democracy&rdquo;.&nbsp; Again, a voucher system and therefore subject to abuse and  countervailing regulation, but otherwise broadly similar to my proposals.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">Neither  Ackerman &amp; Ayres&rsquo; nor Baker&rsquo;s proposal has been implemented as far as I  know. &nbsp;We can be the first!</span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">Dear Mark,</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">I actually read carefully  the Oct 5 draft in the plane and had some comments</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">that I am writing here  below.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">Overall, I like the reach,  the ambitious agenda, and the very creative</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">ideas. This is a very  exciting research agenda, with some neat thoughts.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">On the improvement side,  three main concerns came out for me:</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">1/ the paper mixes 2  different issues: information to improve voting</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">efficiency/effectiveness,  and flows of funds (avoiding capture by private</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">interest groups). Given the  core focus on Infomediaries and Turbocharger, it</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">seemed to me that the  additional points on funding (eg in pp 4-5) was a</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">distraction (including the  Canadian bill on party funding). Information and</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">party funding in elections  are very different issues.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">2/ the core of your argument  is in advocating the creation of infomediaries</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">in different settings and  elections. I think that the paper needs a full</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">theoretical section on how  infomediaries work. The key concern that you have</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">not yet addressed is how you  regulate these intermediaries. In effect, you</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">create a new agent and thus  can be caught in a classic principal-agent</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">problem. How can you ensure  that infomediaries are not captured by key</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">politicians or interest  groups? How do you make sure they do not exploit</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">their position of power for  their own private advantage? Intermediary agents</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">in positions of power,  typically, end up drifting into capture or private</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">pursuit of profit.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">There can also a more  general discussion of the creation of additional</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">interfaces in the democratic  process. Key theorists have long argued for the</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">need of immediacy, ie. The  removal of interfaces in the democratic process,</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">since intermediaries can  create noise, transaction costs, or distortions.</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">For example, will  infomediaries be representative of the average voter or</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">will they represent an elite  with preferences that are different from the</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">median voter? These are  classic problems in democratic theory.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">3/ Finally, at the outset  you jump from corporate governance to the</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">political field, without  pushing further the key difference between the 2</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">fields, namely, that  shareholders bring capital as well as votes. In fact,</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">corporate governance  includes 2 separate dilemmas: managers vs shareholders,</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">but often more importantly  majority shareholders vs minority shareholders.</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">Medium or large shareholders  have means at their disposal that voters in the political system don't. In  many corporate cases, the shareholder college is</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">a concentrated one, whereas  voters in the political system are more numerous</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">and more fragmented. There  could be more discussion of those key differences</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">and how you overcome them in  making the case that the similarities are more</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">important than the  differences. I was not convinced enough yet.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Arial; ">4/ on details: the abstract  is a bit confusing and unclear. The conclusion</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">is good and includes in  particular a good definition of turbo democracy.</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">This should be in the  abstract and the introduction (first paragraph of</span> <span style="font-family:Arial; ">conclusion)</span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">The  paper and the proposal design have evolved considerably since then.&nbsp; In  2004 my design called for voters to allocate funds to media one year in advance  of the election the media were supposed to cover.&nbsp; In 2005 I got the idea  of making the media take the risk of providing coverage first in the hope of  getting paid for it afterward &ndash; harder for the media, but much easier for  voters to decide which media deserved funding.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal style1"><span style="font-family:Tahoma; color:green;">In  large part to respond to Yves&rsquo; questions, I wrote section IV of the current  version of &ldquo;Turbo Democracy&rdquo; as a theoretical section on how these media would  work.</span></p>
