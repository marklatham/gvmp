	        <p align="left" class="content">The  latest annual election for University of British Columbia student  (Alma Mater Society) council was in <strong>January 2007</strong>. To improve voter information for that election, AMS Council  approved  a voter-funded media (VFM) contest, sponsored by VoterMedia.org founder Mark Latham. Contest rules were: </p>
	      <p align="left" class="content"><strong>Media Award Pool: $8,000 total</strong></p>
	      <blockquote>
	        <p align="left" class="content">1st prize = $1500<br />
	          2nd prize = $1400<br />
	          3rd prize = $1200<br />
	          4th prize = $1100<br />
	          5th prize = $900<br />
	          6th prize = $800<br />
	          7th prize = $600<br />
	          8th prize = $500</p>
	        </blockquote>
	      <p align="left" class="content"><strong>Media Contest Entry Fee:</strong> $100</p>
	      <p align="left" class="content"><strong>Media Eligibility:</strong> Open to any person, group or organization,  whether affiliated with UBC or not, except election candidates and members of the Elections Committee or Student Court.</p>
	      <p align="left" class="content"><strong>Contest Judges:</strong> Winners  determined by UBC students voting in the January 2007 AMS Council election.</p>
	      <p align="left" class="content"><strong>Voting Format:</strong> There was a new, additional section on the election ballot, showing the media award contestants. Each student could vote for as many or as few media contestants as desired, by checking (or not checking) the box next to each contestant's name. The media contestant with the most votes got first prize, etc. This is a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">&quot;approval voting&quot;</a>. </p>
	      <p align="left" class="content"> <strong>Judging Criteria:</strong> The contest was intended to encourage election coverage helpful to voters, including analysis of AMS issues, interviews and assessments of electoral candidates, and reviews of the other media contestants. However, students were  free to vote by any criteria they choose. Media contestants could communicate information to student voters via websites and/or any other means, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.ams.ubc.ca/elections/documents/VFM Handbook.pdf">Voter Funded Media Contest Rules</a> established by the AMS Elections Committee.</p>
	      <p align="left" class="content"><strong>Contestant Listing:</strong> Each media contestant's name and web link was displayed on  the <a href="http://www.ams.ubc.ca/elections/vfm.html">AMS Elections website Voter-Funded Media  page</a> promptly after entering the contest. Contestant names were listed on the January 2007 ballot.</p>
	      <p align="left" class="content"><strong>Contest Entry Period:</strong> Entry  deadline was January 19, 2007. Media contestants could begin their coverage of AMS issues as soon as they wished, but were encouraged to review the rules for electoral candidates, especially the restriction that active electoral campaigning was allowed only in the period from January 19-30.
