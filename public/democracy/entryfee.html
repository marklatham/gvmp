		    <h3><strong>VFM Entry Fee Discussion</strong></h3>
		    <p>[Mark Latham, 2007-09-18] </p>
		    <p><strong>Main point:</strong> It&rsquo;s better to  charge an entry fee than to require media entrants to collect signatures,  because an entry fee has far lower social cost.&nbsp;  Entry fees generate funds for running the contest that would otherwise  come from other student fees, whereas collecting signatures creates little  social benefit and increases administrative costs.<br />
		      ================================</p>
		    <p><a href="../ubc/Contest2007-2008.html">UBC&rsquo;s voter-funded media contest</a> offers substantial attractions for  entrants: the $8000 award pool, exposure to many students readers, and the  chance to influence votes, AMS elections and policies.&nbsp; If we don&rsquo;t impose a hurdle to entry, we can  expect a large number of entrants, many of whom may be low quality, which would  overly tax the limited time of voters and electoral candidates.</p>
		    <p>So for the <a href="../ubc/Contest2006-2007.html">first VFM implementation in January 2007</a>, the AMS charged a  $100 entry fee, resulting in 13 contestants &ndash; enough for competition and  diversity of views, but not excessive.&nbsp;  The idea is that only those with a serious chance of winning a prize  would enter.&nbsp; The planning committee for  the coming 2007-2008 contest is proposing a $150 entry fee, because VFM is now  much better known and the entry period will be much longer.</p>
		    <p>One possible alternative to an entry fee would be to require media  entrants to collect some number of student signatures.&nbsp; To be an equivalently effective hurdle, this  should cost about $150 worth of effort.&nbsp;  I don&rsquo;t know what the right number is, but let&rsquo;s suppose it&rsquo;s around 150  signatures.</p>
		    <p>So the cost to entrants would be about the same with either hurdle, but  the net social cost would be much higher for the signature hurdle.&nbsp; This is because the fee is a transfer,  creating a benefit of revenue to the AMS, whereas the time spent collecting  signatures is a social cost creating little or no social benefit.&nbsp; In fact it creates additional costs: pestering  students to sign, and needing administrators to check whether signatures are  valid.</p>
		    <p>As for whether the signers provide any intelligent screening out of low-quality  media entrants, it is much harder for them than for voters deciding the awards  at the end of the contest.&nbsp; By that time,  voters will see the actual performance of all media, aided by media critiquing  each other.&nbsp; The contest voters will be a  far more representative cross-section of students than the friends called upon  by an entrant for signatures.&nbsp; They will  better judge which entrants deserve awards, thus more than refunding the entry  fees of helpful media.</p>
		    <p>Like last year, the entry fees can be used for paying the VFM  Administrator and much needed publicity for the contest.&nbsp; With a signature hurdle, those costs would  come out of other AMS funds.</p>
		    <p>The principle here is the same as in the famous phrase &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch">no free  lunch</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp; Some people seem to think that  benefits paid for by government are like manna from heaven &ndash; free.&nbsp; But we pay for them in our taxes or reduction  of other benefits.&nbsp; Likewise but in the  opposite direction, there is &ldquo;no fee lost&rdquo;: &nbsp;Fees paid to the government don&rsquo;t vanish down a  rat-hole.&nbsp; They reduce our taxes or pay  for benefits.</p>
		    <p>One caveat to these principles is that they are less true the more  corrupt a government is.&nbsp; With a very  corrupt government, maybe fees do disappear down a rat-hole.&nbsp; Does the government belong to all the people,  or to a small group of rats enriching themselves at public expense?</p>
		    <p>We can thus expect voter-funded media to influence public policy toward  broader implementation of green taxes and other user fees for limited public  resources, for two reasons:&nbsp; First, they  will guide and educate voters to recognize the &ldquo;no fee lost&rdquo; principle.&nbsp; And second, as watchdogs they will reduce  perceived and actual corruption in government.&nbsp;  To achieve all this, media will have to build their reputations for  loyalty to voter interests.&nbsp; Voter-funded  payments will reward them for this long-term investment.</p>
		    <p>Vancouver recently saw a clear illustration of the need for building  public trust and understanding of the benefits of user fee systems:</p>
		    <blockquote>
		      <p>&ldquo;It  was unfortunate but not unexpected that motorists reacted with kneejerk anger  to news that the Greater Vancouver Regional District will study options for  road pricing. The concept &ndash; charging tolls to use the region&rsquo;s existing bridges  and perhaps its roads as a way to control congestion &ndash; isn&rsquo;t popular. That&rsquo;s no  big surprise. Nobody wants to pay more for anything, least of all to drive cars  in an era of already high fuel prices. When the phone calls and e-mail started  pouring in, regional politicians ran for cover&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; [Abbotsford News, 2007-03-06]</p>

		    <p class="style1"><strong>The VFM Entry Fee</strong></p>
		    <p class="style1">The Voter-Funded Media contest has a prize pool of $8000, but it costs  each contestant $100 to enter. As Gina Eom recently pointed out, this  represents an &ldquo;access barrier to students entering the contest&rdquo;. $100 is a  large amount of money to the average student who is already feeling the  pressure of unacceptably high levels of tuition.</p>
		    <p class="style1">The contest is already prejudiced towards students who are able to  devote time to self-promotion and quality coverage of the elections. Many  students have to juggle multiple part-time jobs with full course loads, and an  extra $100 burden on top of that might push the contest over the edge into  being blatantly discriminatory.</p>
		    <p class="style1">I was on the committee that adapted Mark Latham&rsquo;s Voter-Media contest  for use in the AMS executive elections. In our preliminary discussion of the  contest, when the proposed entry was $200, I wrote:</p>
		    <blockquote class="style1">
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Having the $200 entry with a high expectation of return and high  variance will, I think, result in the field being mainly larger institutional  media than single intrepid reporters. Larger institutions can stand the  variance much more easily than an individual, because they have a larger pool  of money to start with. The Ubyssey with its $350,000 (this surprised me, btw)  annual budget wouldn&rsquo;t mind another $5,000 but it won&rsquo;t break the bank if they  just lose $200.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My  feeling is that to combat this both the variance and expected return need to be  reduced. Good reporters with minority viewpoints should not be discouraged from  participating because they don&rsquo;t expect people to like what they have to say.  Media providers should not have to labour under such uncertainty that they  might be getting reimbursed for thousands of dollars, or nothing. Rather, I  think it would make more sense to make the probability of winning some portion  of the purse higher, and make the maximum prize available lower.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  would also like to reduce the entry fee required to be in the contest, perhaps  replaced by some other hurdle, such as a full budget proposal and statement of  intent - ie. discourage joke / selfish entrants by making it not worth their  trouble. Then make the maximum award something more reasonable, like $500.  There is still some incentive to do a good job, but covering the election won&rsquo;t  replace your day job. Thus you are more likely to get contributors who care  primarily about the democratic process.</p>
	        </blockquote>
		    <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="style1">I probably didn&rsquo;t push this issue as much as I should, and to be honest  I thought $100 was a reasonable hurdle to clear. Of course I recognized that  there was some prejudicing of candidates, but the primary goal of the contest  was never to be perfectly fair to entrants. It was one of the goals, but it was  a goal that could be compromised in order to further the primary goal of  bringing better information to the voters.</p>
		    <p class="style1">The issue of entry fees was discussed by the committee, with suggestions  ranging from $0 to $35 to $200 being considered. In the end we voted on a $100  entry fee, and I believe all of us were reasonably satisfied with that level.  The contest passed through two discussions at council and one open meeting  without the entry fee issue being raised as an issue of marginalization. It was  only brought up in context of who controls that money and how it will be spent.  This might be a telling reflection on the composition of the AMS council, or it  might just be an oversight.</p>
		    <p class="style1">After the contest had been approved, Gina wrote to the committee  expressing her concerns. Here is a summary of her position that she copied to  Kevin Keystone (AMS President) and the AMS Archives:</p>
		    <blockquote class="style1">
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi  Everyone,<br />
		        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cc.  AMS Archives, Kevin Keystone</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  would like to document my sincere disappointment of this creation of an access  barrier to students entering the contest. The sensitivity of socioeconomic  barriers should be a priority on a student&rsquo;s mind. Through its ignorance we are  perpetuating the cycle of the financially strapped student having to work, and  not have the luxury of being entertained with ideas entering the public sphere.  Entrance of the contest does not equate a guarantee of profit. In fact, a loss  of 100$ is a huge loss and not worth the gamble of a struggling student. This  is a huge demotivating factor.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes  Council approved it, and yes I sit on Council. I suppose this is why I asked  that this trial year be renewed with the current council (NOT October), to iron  out small (or in this case, huge, IMHO) practical flaws of the workings of  this.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  propose there be a system in which students can apply for this fee to be 1)  waived or 2) refunded. The implementation of this system should be retroactive,  or pro-active, depending on how inclusive the VFM committee wants to be. As a  side note, if inclusivity is not a guiding principle of this project, then what  is?</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Another side note - I&rsquo;ve asked to see all the minutes of your committee,  and I did not see a lengthy discussion on the 100$ fee.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your time.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gina  Eom</p>
	        </blockquote>
		    <p class="style1">This is one of my responses to her concerns:</p>
		    <blockquote class="style1">
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey  Gina,</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over  the period that we were discussing VFM I brought up the entry fee thing several  times, but I never really got much traction on it. I agree with you - this  isn&rsquo;t the best kind of barrier to be erecting in the name of filtering out  &ldquo;unserious&rdquo; entrants. There was never a serious discussion of alternatives to a  monetary entry fee. I suggested some sort of more involved application process,  but nobody seemed to like that idea. Perhaps because my financial situation is  different than most, I didn&rsquo;t push on it as much as I could have.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  alternatives to a monetary entry fee seem to be some sort of labour-intensive  process, or an active filtration where we rule on who is or isn&rsquo;t a serious  candidate. The second option goes totally against what we want to do, and the  labour intensive process might be more inhibiting than a monetary one&hellip; it would  also require much more of us / the elections committee. I think we could have  found a better solution, but we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Having no filtration at all would probably result in a mess, where it is  difficult for the voter to get useful information. It could also lead to many  entrants who were in the contest without any intention at all of covering the  election. And of course it would lead to endless headaches for whomever was  administering the contest. There would also be an issue of funding for  promotion of the contest, which is currently being covered by the entry fees.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This  contest is an economist&rsquo;s experiment in democracy. It is rooted in capitalist  ideology. It is not exactly the way I would design something like this, but I&rsquo;m  not the one putting up the prize money. As Steve says, the guiding principle  behind this is serving the voter, not serving the media. Inclusivity is  somewhat derivative from that - an inclusive process will help the voter more  than an exclusive process. But in the end the needs of the voter supersede the  needs of potential contestants, and there needs to be a balance between  inclusivity and effectiveness.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That  being said, I don&rsquo;t think $100 is all that exclusive to students, especially  considering the potential returns. It could also encourage students to team-up  more, to share the cost among a greater number of people. Larger groups are  more desirable from a quality of information perspective.</p>
	        </blockquote>
		    <p class="style1">And this is what Mark Latham wrote:</p>
		    <blockquote class="style1">
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thanks Gina for asking (email below) for my views. Although the  committee hasn&rsquo;t asked, and I prefer to keep my nose out if not invited, I  think I should speak up.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VFM  is all about shifting power from small elites to all voters. I&rsquo;m excited about  the potential for this to spread throughout democracies and corporations,  improving social welfare while lessening disparities of power and wealth. For  VFM to spread, it&rsquo;s very important for it to succeed in this first test  implementation at UBC.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  primary goal of VFM is to better inform voters. To be seen as successful, VFM  needs to deliver on that goal.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  agree with Gina&rsquo;s concern about excluding neglected voices from the VFM  process. The $100 entry fee is a compromise that the committee reached, trading  off between opening access to all potential contestants and protecting voters  from the information overload of having too many media contestants for voters  to be willing to look through. To encourage high quality information, we would  like all entrants to believe they have a serious chance of earning enough voter  support to win a prize. The entry fee helps us achieve that.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While  a $100 fee is clearly more of a hurdle for less wealthy students, likewise the  cash awards are more of an attraction for those students. So the contest is not  all stacked against them, and the cash award effect is probably stronger than  the entry fee effect. As Mike pointed out: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think $100 is all that  exclusive to students, especially considering the potential returns. It could  also encourage students to team-up more, to share the cost among a greater number  of people. Larger groups are more desirable from a quality of information  perspective.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  entry fee acts like an automatic governor on the number of media contestants.  With an $8000 award pool, entrants probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to pay more than a total  of perhaps $2000 in entry fees, given that they also need to work to win an  award. With a $100 fee, that means about 20 entrants. We are trying to help  busy voters. Twenty contestants may already be too many. If we open the door to  more potential entrants who need not pay a fee, the governor is removed and  risk of overload increases.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we  discussed in committee, having an automatic governor keeps all discretionary  control of media funding in the hands of voters rather than the government (or  government appointees who control access to the contest).</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So  the entry fee is not just a way to pay the costs of running the contest. It is  an essential part of the VFM system design.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Suppose the financial need criterion chosen for a fee waiver is one that  10% of students would qualify for. Out of 43,000 UBC students, that&rsquo;s 4,300  people. Of course most would not enter, but we would be saying to those 4,300  that they can enter this cash-prize contest for free, whereas anyone else has  to pay $100. That&rsquo;s an attractive open door. If most of the 4,300 don&rsquo;t even  hear about it then it wouldn&rsquo;t cause a flood of entrants, but we are  publicizing the contest as much as we can, and to be fair we should publicize  all the rules.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those  who are considering entering the contest and paying the fee have to think about  how many other entrants there are likely to be. If we open the door to more  entrants who don&rsquo;t have to pay a fee, some of those who would have paid to  enter may well decide not to enter at all.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovering  $100 from awards won after a fee waiver doesn&rsquo;t reduce the open-door problem  much. Instead of free access to an $8000 contest, it becomes free access to a  $7200 contest.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Besides the administrative burden of defining and applying the financial  need screen, some problematic issues are likely to arise. We expect some people  to enter as groups rather than as individuals. We would have to make rules  about groups that contain some financially needy students and some not. A  group&rsquo;s membership may change over time, as some may join and some leave. It  would be difficult to monitor whether those doing the writing and receiving  possible award funds are the needy students or not; this applies to individual  entrants too.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  contest is open to non-UBC entrants, who are now treated equally with UBC  entrants (except that the judges/voters are all UBC students). I guess only UBC  students would be eligible for the need-based fee waiver. This unequal  treatment would make it even less likely for us to attract off-campus  contestants.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  have already been publicizing the contest with the rules that we agreed on. The  $100 fee is in the code changes and the press release (file attached), on our  websites and in presentations given. People have already been making their  decisions to enter based on those rules.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If  the VFM system can prove its value in this first implementation, it will be  used again and grow stronger. We will all learn more about how it works and how  to improve it. New media will build their reputations, and voters will use them  more. Then we can try various possible enhancements to the system.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But  for now, please don&rsquo;t make this change. It would endanger VFM on its fragile  first step.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash;  Mark</p>
	        </blockquote>
		    <p class="style1">The entry fee is a more complex issue than first appears, as it is  trying to balance two concerns:</p>
		    <p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Be as inclusive as possible<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Ensure that the quality of  information is as high as possible</p>
		    <p class="style1">Probably a better way of achieving these goals would have been to  require each participant to gather 50 signatures before being entered in the  contest, just as AMS Executive candidates must do. This would cut down on the  noise ratio quite a bit without further marginalizing students. However, I  don&rsquo;t think we can implement this system for this iteration of the contest, as:</p>
		    <p class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. There is not enough time.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The VFM contest needs to  cost nothing to the AMS, and it needs this money to pay for a coordinator and  promotions.</p>
		    <p class="style1">It is unfortunate that Gina or I, or anyone, did not propose something like  this earlier, but at this point we have to live with what we&rsquo;ve got, and  attempt to evaluate the possible effects of the entry fee after the contest is  completed.</p>
		    <p class="style1">I would very much like to hear from any students who would like to be in  the contest but feel the $100 is prohibitive to them. There is a real danger  that we will never be able to find such students, as their voices will be  silenced (as often happens in such circumstances). The more students who voice  concerns on this issue and provide alternatives to the current structure, the  better able we will be to find a solution in the future.</p>
