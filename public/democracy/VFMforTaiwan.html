		    2006-01-05<br />
		    Updated 2007-04-22<br />
		    Minor corrections 2009-08-16</em></p>
		  <p>This report is based on my first visit to Taiwan,  November 18 &ndash; December 16, 2005. (I updated it in 2007 to replace the old name &quot;turbo democracy&quot; with the new name &quot;voter-funded media&quot;.)</p>
		  <p><strong>Main point:</strong> The Taiwan  government could set a precedent for a new democratic principle
		    (&ldquo;let voters control some information funding&rdquo;) by  implementing voter-funded media for shareowners in a government-controlled  publicly traded company such as China Steel Corporation.</p>
		  <p align="center"><strong>Who I Am; What  I Do</strong></p>
		  <p>I am an economist doing independent research on  democracy and voter information in civic politics and corporate governance (<a href="/mlresume">my  r&eacute;sum&eacute; here</a>).&nbsp; During the past nine years I have developed a  proposal to improve voter information by letting voters allocate some collectively  owned funds to information providers.&nbsp; I  call this &ldquo;voter-funded media&rdquo; (VFM).</p>
		  <p>I have published it as a corporate governance proposal in numerous <a href="/publications">articles</a> and <a href="/proposals">shareowner resolutions</a> submitted to American companies.&nbsp; However, it has not yet been implemented  anywhere.&nbsp; In recent years I extended the  idea to civic politics &ndash; see the paper &ldquo;Voter-Funded Media&rdquo; at <a href="/publications">votermedia.org/publications</a>.</p>
		  <p>The development stage of this research is largely  complete, and it is time for a test implementation, either for citizens voting  in a political community, or for shareowners voting in a corporate board  election.&nbsp; My top priority now is to make  such a test happen.&nbsp; If it is successful,  VFM can then spread to democracies and corporations around the  world.</p>
		  <p align="center"><strong>Why I  Visited Taiwan</strong></p>
		  <p>Three main reasons:</p>
		  <p>1. Taiwan has major universities where I can discuss  research ideas with professors and students.</p>
		  <p>2. I had never been to Taiwan, in spite of my interest  in Asia.&nbsp; I have lived in India one year,  in Japan four years (I can speak Japanese), in mainland China nine months, Singapore  one month, Nepal one month, and visited Korea (five times), Thailand and  Malaysia.&nbsp; Somehow I had missed Taiwan,  so was overdue for a visit.&nbsp; The  controversy about Taiwan&rsquo;s political status added to my interest in learning  more about it.</p>
		  <p>3. To study mandarin:&nbsp;  As I did in mainland China, I can study the language informally by  living in a place where most people speak it.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>These three were not reasons why I visited  Taiwan:</p>
		  <p>1. I am not an expert or specialist on Taiwan.</p>
		  <p>2. Knowing little about Taiwan&rsquo;s political system, I  did not come with a particular agenda to fix its problems.&nbsp; My research addresses problems I observed in  the political economic systems I am most familiar with, in the USA and  Canada.&nbsp; But like any scientist, I want  to learn from other contexts and explore possible applications anywhere.&nbsp; It was only after deciding to visit that I  learned that the quality and biases of political news media are a big political  issue in Taiwan &ndash; a problem directly addressed by my VFM proposal.&nbsp; I did not even know until after I arrived  that there would be an election during my visit!</p>
		  <p>3. I have no particular stance on the controversial  issue of Taiwan&rsquo;s political status, nor any particular allegiance to either of  Taiwan&rsquo;s competing political factions (KMT/&rdquo;blue&rdquo; and DPP/&rdquo;green&rdquo;).&nbsp; As I have found in the USA and Canada, since  my main contribution is to propose an improvement to our democratic political  systems, it would be a counterproductive distraction to ally with one side.&nbsp; VFM should appeal to citizens  regardless of their political allegiances.</p>
		  <p align="center"><strong>Who I Met</strong></p>
		  <p>Although I planned my Taiwan visit just 17 days before  going, and knew almost no one there, I managed to contact and meet many helpful  people.&nbsp; (My thanks to all those who made  this possible!) &nbsp;Among those I met were  people in these organizations and departments:</p>

		  <p>As I learned from these people about Taiwan politics,  I got the impression that I met more &ldquo;green&rdquo;/DPP sympathizers than  &ldquo;blue&rdquo;/KMT.&nbsp; I will try to balance that  out on my next visit, whenever that may be.</p>
		  <p>I gave three <a href="/presentations">presentations</a> on VFM to graduate  student classes, at NTU College of Law, NTU Department of Finance, and at Shih  Hsin University in journalism.  The students asked many perceptive questions, and I think found my ideas  interesting.</p>
		  <p align="center"><strong>What I  Learned</strong></p>
		  <p>Since my research is about politics, in discussions  with people I learned about Taiwan&rsquo;s history and current political situation,  gaining an overview like the one at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan</a> .</p>
		  <p>Of particular relevance to the idea of VFM  is the political polarization of Taiwan&rsquo;s news media.&nbsp; Many people told me that most Taiwan media are  strongly partisan, either toward green/DPP or toward blue/KMT, and thus do not  help voters make intelligently balanced political decisions.&nbsp; For some discussion of these issues, see  these Editorials at <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/">www.etaiwannews.com</a> :<br />
		    2005-11-24 <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/showPage.php?setupFile=showcontent.xml&amp;menu_item_id=09&amp;did=d_1132799389_21642_73792FE0F7A4938058B33EBB35518E9EDE121023_9&amp;area=taiwan&amp;area_code=00000">Taiwan's  media fails in its civic role</a><br />
		    2005-12-28 <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/showPage.php?setupFile=showcontent.xml&amp;menu_item_id=09&amp;did=d_1135737962_11075_881118E3FA9474F0E956E08B7032D1DD5F389F55_28&amp;area=taiwan&amp;area_code=00000">Hopes  still distant for public media</a><br />
		    This news source itself evidently favours green/DPP, but  nonetheless gives some idea of the state of Taiwan&rsquo;s media.</p>
		  <p>A prominent media controversy is the current green/DPP  administration&rsquo;s battle with the TVBS cable TV network.&nbsp; TVBS has become an influential critic of the  greens, and the DPP government in 2005 moved to enforce against TVBS a law  forbidding over 50% foreign ownership of a Taiwan media organization.&nbsp; Apparently TVBS is Hong Kong owned through a  Taiwan subsidiary.&nbsp; See for example <a href="http://taiwansecurity.org/TN/2005/TN-301005.htm">http://taiwansecurity.org/TN/2005/TN-301005.htm</a> .</p>
		  <p>The government is now reorganizing media regulation  under a new National Communications Commission (NCC), but the bipartisan  negotiation process for nominating NCC members is inevitably polarized.&nbsp; As the dust settles, it seems the NCC will be  majority blue/KMT &ndash; see for example <a href="http://jujuflop.yule.org/2005/12/15/politics-and-media-control">http://jujuflop.yule.org/2005/12/15/politics-and-media-control</a> .</p>
		  <p>VFM offers a creative solution instead of  a suppressive solution to media bias.&nbsp;  Rather than trying to restrict biased news and thus being accused of violating  freedom of the press, the government could let voters control some information  funding.&nbsp; This would create new political  news media more loyal to the interests of Taiwan voters.</p>
		  <p>However, it should first be tested on a small scale.</p>
		  <p align="center"><strong>How to Test  Voter-Funded Media in Taiwan</strong></p>
		  <p>VFM is not a Taiwan-specific  proposal.&nbsp; I designed it originally to  help people vote their shares in American corporations, then translated it to  help citizens vote in democratic elections, again thinking mainly about the USA  and Canada where I have lived.&nbsp; But it  should be useful wherever voters lack information, a globally pervasive  problem.&nbsp; Thus to test this proposal, almost  anywhere will do (anywhere with competitive voting), and if successful it can  spread globally regardless of where it started.</p>
		  <p>My current favorite candidates for test sites are  university student council elections in Canada and the USA.&nbsp; The reasons and test design are explained in <a href="/publications">Global Voter Media Platform</a>.&nbsp; Some of these student councils control  substantial budgets (e.g. $2 million per year), and students are more open to  trying something new and changing the world.</p>
		  <p>Student councils in Taiwan, however, have much smaller  budgets, so it would not seem meaningful to spend the US$10,000 that I estimate  it would take to fund a test.&nbsp; There is  not enough at stake, and voters may not feel enough need for better  information.</p>
		  <p>Taiwan could just wait and see if VFM gets  tested in the USA or Canada.&nbsp; But I have  barely started pitching the idea, so there is no telling when such a test might  take place.&nbsp; Perhaps there are other ways  to test it in Taiwan.&nbsp; A municipal or  county election might be worth considering, except for two problems.&nbsp; First, local elections were all recently held  in December 2005, so will not come up again for four years.&nbsp; Second, the test would require Taiwan National  Assembly approval to amend the local election law, a substantial political  undertaking likely to face opposition.</p>
		  <p>Another test strategy is for the Taiwan government to  implement VFM for shareowners in a publicly traded corporation where  the government holds a controlling stake, such as China Steel Corporation.&nbsp; This would take the form of a &ldquo;Proxy Advisor&rdquo;  proposal such as those shown <a href="/proposals">here</a>.&nbsp; Shareowners would vote each year to  hire one or more proxy advisors to give independent recommendations on how to  vote in director elections and any other decisions in the following year&rsquo;s  proxy.&nbsp; (Director elections are excluded from <a href="/proposals">those proposals</a> to satisfy a legal technicality that would not apply in Taiwan.)</p>
		  <p>Although corporate shareowner voting seems quite distinct from citizen voting in a  democracy, voters in both settings face similar information problems.&nbsp; The Taiwan government could thus set  a precedent for a new democratic principle: that voters should control some  information funding.&nbsp; Spreading this  principle across corporations and across democracies would then become a  fundamental reform of political news media, creating new media organizations  loyal to voter interests.</p>
		  <p>This corporate proxy advisor proposal has not yet  gained enough support for test implementation in the USA.&nbsp; The highest shareowner support so far has  been a 20% &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in April 2004.&nbsp; The  USA does not have government-controlled publicly traded corporations, and  boards of directors naturally oppose such a reduction in their autonomy and  power, always campaigning against it.&nbsp;  Thus Taiwan has an opportunity to pioneer this innovation, setting a new  standard for corporate governance and democracy.</p>
		  As explained in the conclusion of the paper &ldquo;<a href="../publications/VoterFundedMedia.pdf">Voter-Funded Media</a>&rdquo;, this reform  can eventually reduce international tension by helping citizens of different  countries find a consensus perspective on global problems.&nbsp; By reducing corruption in democratic systems,  it can also make democracy a more effective and attractive alternative for  countries that have not yet chosen to become democratic.		  <p align="left" class="content">&nbsp;		     </p></td>
