		    <h3 align="center">Vancouver  Election Blog Awards Terms</h3>
		    <p>Participation by voters and contestants is subject to  these terms. We (the awards administrator, which as of May 2008 is <a href="/about_contact">Mark  Latham</a>) may change these terms at any time. Media/blog entrants and voters may stop participating  at any time if unwilling to accept then-current terms. Current terms are posted  at <a href="/van/terms.html">http://votermedia.org/van/terms.html</a>.  Notice of changes in these terms posted at <a href="http://votermedia.blogspot.com/">http://votermedia.blogspot.com</a> is  deemed sufficient notification to voters and media/blog entrants.</p>
		    <p>The awards ballot main page is accessed via internet  URL <a href="/van">http://votermedia.org/van</a>;  other related pages are linked from there. Contest void where prohibited by  law.</p>
		    <p>For each media/blog entrant, we try to find a  member of that contestant's team (or organization) who will faithfully represent the interests of the team in this contest. We follow that representative's instructions in paying out any awards won by that media/blog. This usually means that we pay awards to the representative, who then takes care of any distribution within that team. Representatives are listed at <a href="/van/reps.html">http://votermedia.org/van/reps.html</a>. Please <a href="/about_contact">let us know</a> if there is any problem with a representative. We are not required to change award payments that have already been made, but will try to pay future awards appropriately.</p>
		    <p><strong>Experimental  Contest</strong></p>
		    <p>This is an experimental contest with imperfect  infrastructure, lacking a secure login for each voter. We disclaim all  warranties of any kind. We will not be liable for any damages or costs. The  contest may evolve through time and produce various results and effects,  expected and unexpected. Media/blog entrants and voters agree to accept such evolution,  results and effects without recourse, including such possibilities as these:</p>
		    <p>(a) information technology systems may malfunction;<br />
		      (b) information technology services may be  interrupted;<br />
		      (c) the voting process could be corrupted by improper  influence or people voting multiple times;<br />
		      (d) some votes may not be counted, or may be under- or  over-weighted;<br />
		      (e) some votes by non-Vancouverites may be counted;<br />
		      (e) people may vote in unexpected ways for unexpected  reasons;<br />
		      (f) voter turnout may be very low;<br />
		      (g) the sample of votes received may not be  representative of all Vancouverites&rsquo; voting preferences;<br />
		      (h) media/blogs may get higher or lower rankings than they  deserve;<br />
		      (i) rankings may fluctuate excessively through time;<br />
		      (j) media/blogs&rsquo; reputations may be harmed;<br />
		      (k) the awards administrator may make mistakes, such as 
		      choosing a media/blog entrant representative that does not faithfully represent that entrant's team members.</p>
		    <p><strong>Administrator  Discretion</strong></p>
		    <p>So as to effectively manage this experimental contest  in response to various possible unexpected eventualities, we may at any time,  with or without cause:</p>
		    <p>(a) add any new contestants (which may be individuals,  groups or organizations, in Vancouver or elsewhere, including politicians,  electoral candidates, political parties, unions and corporations) to any places  in the ranking;<br />
		      (b) reject any suggested or applying entrants to the  contest;<br />
		      (c) disallow any contestant name, for example if it  may be misleading or confusing;<br />
		      (d) remove any contestant from the contest;<br />
		      (e) change the contest terms;<br />
		      (f) change the voting system, tallying and ranking  update methods;<br />
		      (g) change the layout and number of ballot pages;<br />
		      (h) change amounts, distribution and timing of awards;<br />
		      (i) terminate contest awards;<br />
		      (j) terminate the contest;<br />
		      (k) choose a new administrator;<br />
		      (l) accept donations and/or sponsorship from any  source;<br />
		      (m) accept advertising on contest web pages;<br />
		      (n) discuss the contest and contestants publicly,  including in ways that may be considered biased in favour of or against one or  more contestants;<br />
		      (o) change the contest's name;<br />
		      (p) 
		      change the contest's focus from Vancouver to British Columbia and back again.</p>
		    <p>Vote tallying and updating of ranks are not audited,  and may involve our subjective discretion. We need not disclose the vote  tallying and ranking update methods, nor the vote totals. If anyone believes  that we are acting unreasonably, their only recourse is to stop participating in  this contest and/or to participate in a different contest.</p>
		    <p><strong>Participant  Discretion</strong></p>
		    <p>Contestants and voters may stop participating at any  time. Contestants may compete in any way they choose (subject to any applicable  laws). We are not responsible for contestants&rsquo; media content. Voters may vote  on whatever basis they choose.</p>
		    <p>We refer to contestants as &ldquo;media&rdquo; or &ldquo;bloggers&rdquo; and  call this a blog contest based on what we think contestants will do, but we  do not actually require contestants to act like media or be bloggers. This  contest is designed to benefit the voting community, and many types of benefit  are possible. We think contestants will win votes by providing such benefits as  blogs, websites, newspapers and broadcasts giving insight on Vancouver civic  issues, especially those decided by vote. This includes not only elections but  also this contest itself &ndash; contestants could publish evaluations of each other.</p>
